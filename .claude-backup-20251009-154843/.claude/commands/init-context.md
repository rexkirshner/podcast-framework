# /init-context Command

Initialize a **minimal overhead** context system for this project. Creates 5 core files (CONTEXT.md, STATUS.md, DECISIONS.md, SESSIONS.md, QUICK_REF.md), with optional files suggested when complexity demands.

**Philosophy:** Minimal overhead during work. Good-enough recovery when needed. Single source of truth.

**See also:**
- `.claude/docs/command-philosophy.md` for core principles

## What This Command Does

Creates **5 core files** that serve dual purpose (developer productivity + AI agent review/takeover):
1. **CONTEXT.md** - Orientation (rarely changes: who/what/how/why)
2. **STATUS.md** - Current state (frequently updated: tasks/blockers/next)
3. **DECISIONS.md** - Decision log (WHY choices made - critical for AI agents)
4. **SESSIONS.md** - History (structured, comprehensive, append-only)
5. **QUICK_REF.md** - Dashboard (auto-generated from STATUS.md)

Optional files (PRD.md, ARCHITECTURE.md) suggested when complexity demands.

## Why 5 Core Files?

**The Dual Purpose:**
1. **Session continuity** - Resume work seamlessly
2. **AI agent review/takeover** - Enable AI to understand WHY, review code, take over development

**Real-world feedback revealed:**
- System isn't just for you - it's for AI agents reviewing and improving your work
- AI agents need to understand WHY decisions were made, not just WHAT code exists
- TodoWrite for productivity during work, rich docs for AI at save points
- DECISIONS.md is critical - AI needs rationale, constraints, tradeoffs

**v1.8.0 approach:**
- CONTEXT.md for orientation (rarely changes)
- STATUS.md for current state (single source of truth)
- **DECISIONS.md for rationale (AI agents understand WHY)**
- SESSIONS.md structured but comprehensive (mental models, 40-60 lines)
- QUICK_REF.md auto-generated (fast orientation)
- PRD/ARCHITECTURE when complexity demands

## Execution Steps

### Step 0: Verify Working Directory and .claude Location

**CRITICAL:** Check for multiple .claude directories in the path. This causes conflicts.

```bash
# Get absolute path to current directory
CURRENT_DIR=$(pwd)
echo "Working directory: $CURRENT_DIR"

# Check for .claude directories in parent path
CLAUDE_DIRS=$(find "$CURRENT_DIR" -maxdepth 0 -name ".claude" -o -path "*/.claude" | grep -c ".claude" || echo "0")

# Also check parent directories up to 3 levels
PARENT_CLAUDE=$(find "$CURRENT_DIR/.." -maxdepth 2 -name ".claude" 2>/dev/null | grep -v "$CURRENT_DIR/.claude" || echo "")

if [ -n "$PARENT_CLAUDE" ]; then
  echo ""
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: Multiple .claude directories detected!"
  echo ""
  echo "Current project: $CURRENT_DIR/.claude"
  echo "Parent folder(s): $PARENT_CLAUDE"
  echo ""
  echo "‚ùå PROBLEM: Claude Code may use the wrong .claude directory"
  echo "This causes commands to be loaded from the parent instead of this project."
  echo ""
  echo "‚úÖ SOLUTION: Only keep .claude in the actual project root"
  echo "Remove .claude from parent folders that aren't projects themselves."
  echo ""
  echo "Recommended action:"
  echo "  1. If parent folder is NOT a project: rm -rf <parent>/.claude"
  echo "  2. If parent folder IS a project: Move this project out of it"
  echo ""
  read -p "Continue anyway? [y/N] " -n 1 -r
  echo
  if [[ ! $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
    echo "Cancelled. Please resolve .claude directory conflicts first."
    exit 1
  fi
fi
```

### Step 1: Check Existing Context

```
Check if context/ folder already exists:
- If exists: Warn user and ask if they want to reinitialize
- If not: Proceed to Step 2
```

### Step 2: Analyze Project

Gather information about the project:

**File System Analysis:**
- Run `ls -la` to see root structure
- Check for package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod, requirements.txt, etc.
- Identify project type (web app, CLI, library, API, etc.)
- Find README.md if exists

**Git Analysis (if git repo):**
- Run `git log --oneline -10` for recent history
- Run `git remote -v` to find repo URL
- Check current branch with `git branch --show-current`

**Technology Stack:**
- Read package.json for Node.js projects
- Read Cargo.toml for Rust projects
- Read go.mod for Go projects
- Read requirements.txt for Python projects
- Identify framework (Next.js, React, Express, etc.)

### Step 3: Create Minimal Folder Structure

Create only what we need right now:

```bash
mkdir -p context
mkdir -p artifacts/code-reviews
mkdir -p artifacts/lighthouse
mkdir -p artifacts/performance
mkdir -p artifacts/security
mkdir -p artifacts/bundle-analysis
mkdir -p artifacts/coverage
```

### Step 4: Generate Core Documentation Files

Create the **5 core files** from templates:

**context/CONTEXT.md** - Orientation (rarely changes)
- Project overview (from README or git description)
- Tech stack (from package analysis)
- Commands (from package.json scripts or Makefile)
- Architecture basics (inferred from folder structure)
- **Communication preferences and workflow rules**
- **"Core Development Methodology" section**
- **References other files for current work** (no duplication)

**context/STATUS.md** - Current state (frequently updated)
- Current phase/focus
- Active tasks (checkboxes)
- Work in progress
- Recent accomplishments
- Next session priorities
- **Single source of truth for "what's happening now"**

**context/DECISIONS.md** - Decision log (critical for AI agents)
- Initialize with template and "Guidelines for AI Agents" section
- Empty active decisions table ready for use
- Example decision showing proper format
- **Critical for AI agents to understand WHY choices were made**

**context/SESSIONS.md** - History (structured, comprehensive)
- First entry documenting initialization (structured format with mental models)
- Session index table
- Template for future entries (40-60 lines with depth)
- **Comprehensive enough for AI agent understanding**

**context/QUICK_REF.md** - Dashboard (auto-generated)
- Project name and current phase
- Tech stack summary
- URLs (production, staging, local, repo)
- Current focus and next priority
- Quick commands
- Auto-generated by `/save-context`

### Step 5: Create Configuration

**ACTION:** Use the Bash tool to copy the template config and update placeholders:

```bash
# Download the latest config template from GitHub
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rexkirshner/claude-context-system/main/config/.context-config.template.json -o context/.context-config.json

# Update placeholders (project name, owner, dates)
# Use Read tool to get current config, then Edit tool to replace placeholders with actual values
```

**IMPORTANT:** You MUST:
1. Use Read tool to read `context/.context-config.json`
2. Use Edit tool to replace ALL placeholders:
   - `[Your Name]` ‚Üí actual owner name
   - `[Project Name]` ‚Üí actual project name
   - `[web-app|cli|library|api]` ‚Üí actual project type
   - `[YYYY-MM-DD]` ‚Üí today's date

### Step 6: Explain Dual-Purpose Philosophy

After initialization, explain to the user:

```
‚úÖ Context System Initialized (v2.0.0)

Created 5 core files:
- context/CONTEXT.md - Orientation (who/what/how/why)
- context/STATUS.md - Current state (tasks/blockers/next)
- context/DECISIONS.md - Decision log (WHY choices made)
- context/SESSIONS.md - History (structured, comprehensive)
- context/QUICK_REF.md - Dashboard (auto-generated)
- context/.context-config.json - Configuration

‚ö° Two-Tier Workflow:

**Tier 1: Quick Updates (Most Sessions)**
Run /save at session end - 2-3 minutes
- Updates STATUS.md (current tasks, blockers, next steps)
- Auto-generates QUICK_REF.md
- Minimal overhead, continuous work

**Tier 2: Comprehensive Documentation (Occasional)**
Run /save-full before breaks/handoffs - 10-15 minutes
- Everything /save does
- PLUS: Creates detailed SESSIONS.md entry
- PLUS: Documents mental models and decision rationale
- Use ~3-5 times per 20 sessions

**Time Investment for 20 Sessions:**
- 17√ó /save: ~40-50 min
- 3√ó /save-full: ~30-45 min
- Total: ~70-95 min (50% reduction from v1.8.0)

üéØ Philosophy:

**Within sessions:** TodoWrite for productivity (minimal overhead)
**At save points:** /save for quick state capture (2-3 min)
**Before breaks:** /save-full for comprehensive docs (10-15 min)

This system enables AI agents to:
- Review your code with full context
- Understand WHY you made decisions
- Take over development seamlessly
- Learn from your problem-solving approaches

üìä Single Source of Truth:

Each piece of information lives in ONE place:
- Current tasks ‚Üí STATUS.md
- Project overview ‚Üí CONTEXT.md
- Decision rationale ‚Üí DECISIONS.md
- History + mental models ‚Üí SESSIONS.md (created by /save-full)

ü§ñ For AI Agents:

**DECISIONS.md is critical** - Captures WHY choices were made:
- Rationale and constraints
- Alternatives considered
- Tradeoffs accepted

**SESSIONS.md captures thinking** - AI agents learn from:
- Your mental models
- Problem-solving approaches
- Evolution of your understanding

üìà Growing Your Documentation:

When complexity demands it, I'll suggest:
- **PRD.md** ‚Üí Product vision documentation
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** ‚Üí System design documentation

Next Steps:
1. Review context/CONTEXT.md for accuracy
2. Use TodoWrite during active work
3. Run /save at session end (2-3 min quick update)
4. Run /save-full before breaks/handoffs (10-15 min comprehensive)
5. Use /code-review for AI agent review when ready
6. Start coding!
```

### Step 7: Cleanup Installation Files

**IMPORTANT:** Remove the installation files that were downloaded from GitHub to keep the project clean.

**ACTION:** Use the Bash tool to remove installation directory:

```bash
# Check if we're in a nested installation (common pattern)
if [ -d "../claude-context-system" ]; then
  echo "üßπ Removing installation files..."
  rm -rf ../claude-context-system
  echo "‚úÖ Installation files removed"
elif [ -d "./claude-context-system" ]; then
  echo "üßπ Removing installation files..."
  rm -rf ./claude-context-system
  echo "‚úÖ Installation files removed"
else
  echo "‚è≠Ô∏è  No installation files found (already clean)"
fi

# Also check for downloaded zip
if [ -f "../claude-context-system.zip" ]; then
  rm -f ../claude-context-system.zip
  echo "‚úÖ Removed installation zip"
fi
```

## Template Content Guidelines

When filling templates, use this priority:

1. **From project files**: Use actual data from package.json, README, git
2. **Inferred from structure**: Make educated guesses from folder layout
3. **Generic placeholders**: Use `[TODO: Add ...]` for unknown info
4. **Smart defaults**: Always include standard preferences and workflow rules

## On-Demand File Creation

When `/save-context` runs, it should check if additional documentation is needed:

**Check for ARCHITECTURE.md need:**
- Project has >20 files in src/
- Multiple directories with different purposes
- Complex dependency relationships
- Ask: "Your architecture is getting complex. Should I create ARCHITECTURE.md for AI agents to understand system design?"

**Check for PRD.md need:**
- Product vision discussed multiple times
- Feature roadmap getting complex
- Ask: "Product scope is expanding. Should I create PRD.md to document vision and roadmap for AI agent context?"

**v2.0 Note:** We always create DECISIONS.md because it's critical for AI agents to understand WHY choices were made. Only ARCHITECTURE.md and PRD.md are suggested on-demand when complexity demands it.

## Important Notes

- Always include workflow preferences in CONTEXT.md
- CONTEXT.md must include "no lazy coding" and "simplicity first" rules
- Configuration must enforce "no push without approval"
- STATUS.md is single source of truth for current state
- **DECISIONS.md is critical for AI agents** - always create it
- CONTEXT.md references other files, doesn't duplicate
- SESSIONS.md uses structured format (40-60 lines with mental models)
- **Structured ‚â† minimal** - AI agents need comprehensive depth
- QUICK_REF.md is auto-generated, never edited manually
- Use bullet points and clear headings
- **Dual purpose:** developer productivity + AI agent review/takeover

## Error Handling

If errors occur:
- Report what failed clearly
- Show what was successfully created
- Provide manual recovery steps
- Never leave partial initialization

## Success Criteria

Command succeeds when:
- 5 core files (CONTEXT.md, STATUS.md, DECISIONS.md, SESSIONS.md, QUICK_REF.md) created with available data
- All files use v2.0 structure and format
- Configuration valid
- Installation files cleaned up
- User understands dual-purpose philosophy (developer + AI agent)
- User knows DECISIONS.md is for AI agent understanding
- User can immediately run /save-context
- Clear next steps provided
