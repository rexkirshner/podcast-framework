# Usage Examples

Real-world workflows showing how to use the Claude Context System in common scenarios.

## Overview

This guide demonstrates practical usage patterns for different situations. Each example shows:
- When to use which commands
- What to expect at each step
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- Success criteria

---

## Example 1: Daily Development Flow

**Scenario:** Active development on an existing project with context system already initialized.

### Morning: Session Start

```
1. Open project in Claude Code
2. Run: /review-context
```

**What happens:**
```
üìã Context Review Report

**Confidence Score: 95/100** - Perfect

‚úÖ **Accurate Documentation:**
- CLAUDE.md - All current, verified
- SESSIONS.md - Last entry yesterday, complete WIP
- next-steps.md - 3 action items ready

**Last Session:** Session 23 - 2025-10-03
**Last Work:** Implementing user profile page (complete)
**Resume Point:** Start next feature from backlog

**Recommendation:** ‚úÖ Ready to resume work immediately

**Next Steps from docs:**
1. Add user settings page
2. Implement account deletion flow
3. Add profile photo upload

Ready to continue?
```

**Your response:** "Yes, let's start with the user settings page"

### During Work: Frequent Checkpoints

**Every 30-60 minutes while coding:**

```
/quick-save-context
```

**What happens:**
```
‚úÖ Quick checkpoint saved

Updated:
- SESSIONS.md - Added progress note
- next-steps.md - Marked settings page in progress

Time: ~5 seconds
```

**Why:** Lightweight safety net. If session crashes, you have recent checkpoint.

### After Completing Feature

```
/save-context
```

**What happens:**
```
‚úÖ Context Updated

**Files Updated:**
- CLAUDE.md - Updated feature list, added settings page
- PRD.md - Marked feature complete in progress log
- SESSIONS.md - Complete session 24 entry with accomplishments
- next-steps.md - Settings page marked done, moved to next item

**Key Changes Captured:**
- Implemented user settings page (app/settings/page.tsx)
- Added settings API route (app/api/settings/route.ts)
- Created SettingsForm component (components/SettingsForm.tsx)
- Decided to use form validation library 'zod'

**Current Status:** User Management - 75% complete

**Next Session:** Implement account deletion flow
```

### End of Day: Session Close

```
/save-context
```

**Even if you just ran it 10 minutes ago.** Why? Ensures clean session boundary with proper WIP capture if needed.

**What happens:**
```
‚úÖ Context Updated

**Work In Progress:**
- Started account deletion flow
- Currently at: app/api/account/delete/route.ts:23
- Next: Add confirmation modal component
- Mental model: Two-step delete (email confirm + password verify)

**Next Session:** Complete deletion flow, test thoroughly
```

## Example 2: New Project Setup

**Scenario:** Just created a new Next.js app, want to add context system.

### Step 1: Get the System

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/rexkirshner/claude-context-system.git

# Copy commands to your project
cd my-new-project
mkdir -p .claude
cp -r ../claude-context-system/.claude/commands .claude/

# Clean up
rm -rf ../claude-context-system
```

### Step 2: Initialize in Claude Code

```
/init-context
```

**What happens:**
```
üéØ Initializing Claude Context System

**Step 1: Analyzing project...**
- Detected: Next.js 14 application
- Package manager: npm
- Found: package.json, src/, app/ directories

**Step 2: Creating context structure...**
‚úÖ Created context/
‚úÖ Created context/tasks/
‚úÖ Created context/reviews/

**Step 3: Generating documentation...**
‚úÖ CLAUDE.md (analyzed project structure)
‚úÖ PRD.md (with project name from package.json)
‚úÖ ARCHITECTURE.md (detected Next.js App Router)
‚úÖ CODE_STYLE.md (with your workflow preferences)
‚úÖ DECISIONS.md (empty, ready for decisions)
‚úÖ KNOWN_ISSUES.md (empty, ready for issues)

‚úÖ next-steps.md (initial setup tasks)
‚úÖ todo.md (empty, ready for tasks)

**Step 4: Configuration...**
‚úÖ .context-config.json created

**‚úÖ Initialization Complete!**

Next steps:
1. Review context/CLAUDE.md - verify project info
2. Review context/PRD.md - add project goals
3. Run /save-context to establish Session 1 baseline
```

### Step 3: Customize Documentation

Review and customize the generated files:
- Update project description in CLAUDE.md
- Add project goals to PRD.md
- Document initial architecture decisions

### Step 4: Establish Baseline

```
/save-context
```

**What happens:**
```
‚úÖ Context Updated

**Session 1 Baseline Established**

This is your starting point. All future sessions build on this.

Ready to start coding!
```

## Example 3: After Long Break (2+ Weeks)

**Scenario:** You haven't touched a project in weeks, maybe months. Need to resume work.

### Step 1: Review Context

```
/review-context
```

**What happens:**
```
üìã Context Review Report

**Confidence Score: 72/100** - Adequate

‚úÖ **Accurate Documentation:**
- CLAUDE.md - Current
- ARCHITECTURE.md - Matches code

‚ö†Ô∏è **Issues Found:**
- SESSIONS.md - Last entry 3 weeks old
- KNOWN_ISSUES.md - May have resolved issues not documented
- next-steps.md - Priorities may have shifted

**Last Session:** Session 15 - 2025-09-13
**Last Work:** Refactoring authentication system
**Resume Point:** WIP at lib/auth.ts:145 - token refresh logic

**Recommendation:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Review gaps before continuing

**Suggested Actions:**
1. Check git log for work since last session
2. Review current code state vs documented state
3. Update KNOWN_ISSUES.md if issues resolved
4. Run /save-context to update documentation
```

### Step 2: Investigate Gaps

```bash
# Check what happened since last session
git log --oneline --since="2025-09-13"

# Check current state
git status
git diff
```

**You discover:** 2 commits were made, authentication refactor was completed.

### Step 3: Update Documentation

```
/save-context
```

**In your message to Claude:**
"The authentication refactor was completed. Commits show token refresh logic was implemented and tested. Please update documentation to reflect this is done."

**What happens:**
```
‚úÖ Context Updated

**Updated based on git history:**
- SESSIONS.md - Added retrospective entries for completed work
- KNOWN_ISSUES.md - Removed auth refresh limitation (now fixed)
- next-steps.md - Marked auth refactor complete
- PRD.md - Updated progress (Authentication: 100% complete)

**Current Status:** Ready for next feature

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement user profile management
2. Add email verification
```

### Step 4: Resume Fresh

Now run `/review-context` again:

```
üìã Context Review Report

**Confidence Score: 94/100** - Perfect

‚úÖ Ready to resume work immediately

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement user profile management
2. Add email verification
```

**Key Lesson:** After long breaks, always:
1. Run /review-context first
2. Check git history for gap
3. Run /save-context to update
4. Then resume work

---

## Example 4: Team Handoff

**Scenario:** You need to hand off a project to another developer or Claude instance.

### Step 1: Ensure Documentation Current

```
/save-context
```

**Make sure everything is captured:**
- All recent work documented
- WIP state clear
- Known issues listed
- Next steps defined

### Step 2: Validate Quality

```
/validate-context
```

**What happens:**
```
üìã Context Validation Report

**Health Score: 95/100** - Excellent

‚úÖ **Structure:**
- All required files present
- All sections complete

‚úÖ **Content Quality:**
- No placeholders unfilled
- Consistent across docs

‚ö†Ô∏è **Minor Issues:**
- SESSIONS.md: 2 entries could be more detailed
- DECISIONS.md: 1 decision missing "when to reconsider"

**Recommendation:** ‚úÖ Ready for handoff (minor issues non-blocking)
```

### Step 3: Export for Sharing

```
/export-context
```

**What happens:**
```
‚úÖ Export Complete

**File created:** context-export-2025-10-04.md

**Contents:**
- Complete table of contents
- All context documentation in one file
- 2,450 lines total
- Easy to read and search

**Location:** Current directory

Share this file with:
- Team members
- Other Claude instances
- External reviewers
- Backup/archive
```

### Step 4: Handoff Message

**Send to new developer:**
```
Here's the project context export. To get started:

1. Read context-export-2025-10-04.md (or import to context/)
2. Run /review-context to verify
3. Start working - everything you need is documented

Current status: User auth complete, profile management in progress.
Next: Implement profile edit form (see next-steps.md)
```

**New developer:**
```
/review-context
```

**They get full context immediately. No 30-minute explanation call needed.**

---

## Example 5: Quality Check Workflow

**Scenario:** Feature complete, want thorough quality check before deployment.

### Step 1: Ensure Documentation Current

```
/save-context
```

**Critical:** Review must reflect current code state.

### Step 2: Run Validation

```
/validate-context
```

**What happens:**
```
üìã Context Validation Report

**Health Score: 92/100** - Excellent

‚úÖ Documentation is current and complete

Minor suggestions:
- Add more details to 2 recent decisions
- Document workaround for known issue #3

**Recommendation:** ‚úÖ Ready for code review
```

### Step 3: Comprehensive Code Review

```
/code-review
```

**What to expect:**
- This takes time (10-30 minutes depending on code size)
- Thorough analysis of all code
- No changes made (read-only review)

**What happens:**
```
üîç Starting Code Review

This will be thorough and unhurried.
I will NOT make any changes during this review.
All issues found will be documented for fixing later.

[... comprehensive analysis ...]

‚úÖ Code Review Complete

**Report saved to:** artifacts/code-reviews/session-24-review.md

**Summary:**
- Grade: B+
- Critical Issues: 0
- High Priority: 2
- Medium Priority: 5
- Low Priority: 8

**Top 3 Recommendations:**
1. Add input validation to user settings form (HIGH)
2. Optimize profile image loading (MEDIUM)
3. Add error boundary to settings page (MEDIUM)

**Next Steps:**
1. Review full report
2. Prioritize fixes
3. Address in new session (don't fix during review!)
```

### Step 4: Review Report

**Read:** `artifacts/code-reviews/session-24-review.md`

**Example issue from report:**
```markdown
### High Priority Issues

**H1: Missing input validation**
- Severity: High
- Location: components/SettingsForm.tsx:45-67
- Issue: Email field accepts any string without validation
- Impact: Invalid emails can be submitted
- Root Cause: Form validation library configured but not applied to this field
- Suggestion: Add zod email schema: z.string().email()
- Effort: 5 minutes
```

### Step 5: Fix in New Session

**Key principle:** Review finds problems, fixes happen separately.

```
Let's address the high priority issues from the review:
1. Add email validation to settings form
2. Optimize profile image loading

[work on fixes...]
```

### Step 6: After Fixes

```
/save-context
```

**Document what was fixed:**
```
Accomplishments:
- ‚úÖ Fixed email validation (issue H1 from review)
- ‚úÖ Optimized profile image loading (issue H2 from review)
```

---

## Example 6: Emergency Recovery

**Scenario:** Session crashed mid-work, unsaved changes lost.

### Step 1: Don't Panic

Your last `/save-context` or `/quick-save-context` preserved most work.

### Step 2: Review What Was Saved

```
/review-context
```

**What happens:**
```
üìã Context Review Report

**Confidence Score: 88/100** - Good

**Last Session:** Session 18 - 2025-10-04 14:35
**Last Work:** Implementing notification system

**Work In Progress:**
- Creating notification API route
- Currently at: app/api/notifications/route.ts:45
- Next: Add database schema for notifications
- Approach: Real-time updates via Server-Sent Events

**Files Modified (from last save):**
- app/api/notifications/route.ts (partial)
- lib/notifications.ts (helper functions)

**Likely Lost:**
- Any work after 14:35 (last quick-save)
- Estimate: 15-20 minutes of work
```

### Step 3: Check Git

```bash
git status
git diff
```

**See what's uncommitted.** May recover some work.

### Step 4: Resume From Last Known State

Start from the documented WIP point. You have:
- Exact file and line number
- The approach you were taking
- Next action to take

**This is why WIP capture is critical.**

### Step 5: Prevent Future Loss

**Going forward:**
- Run `/quick-save-context` every 15-30 minutes
- Run `/save-context` after any significant work
- Commit to git more frequently

**Remember:** Better to over-save than lose context.

## Example 7: Debugging Session

**Scenario:** Complex bug, need to track investigation and solution.

### Step 1: Document the Bug

**Before debugging, capture the issue:**

```
/save-context
```

**In message to Claude:**
"Found a bug: User profile images aren't loading on production. Works locally. Need to debug."

### Step 2: Investigation

**As you debug, track decisions:**

```
We've discovered:
1. Images load locally but not in production
2. Console shows CORS errors
3. Images are served from different origin in production

This is a CORS configuration issue.
```

### Step 3: Document Decision

**When you choose an approach:**

```
/save-context
```

**Captures in DECISIONS.md:**
```markdown
## Image CORS Configuration - 2025-10-04

**Decision:** Configure CORS headers on image CDN to allow our production domain

**Context:** Production images failing due to CORS. Localhost worked because same-origin.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Serve images from same domain - Requires infrastructure change, slower
- Use proxy endpoint - Adds latency, wastes server resources
- Configure CDN CORS - Simple, performant, correct solution

**Trade-offs:**
- Pros: Fast, simple, follows best practices
- Cons: Requires CDN configuration access

**Implementation:** Added allowed origins to CDN config

**When to Reconsider:**
- If we change CDN providers
- If we need more complex access control
```

### Step 4: Capture Solution

```
/save-context
```

**Captures in SESSIONS.md:**
```markdown
**Accomplishments:**
- ‚úÖ Debugged production image loading issue
- ‚úÖ Root cause: CORS misconfiguration on CDN
- ‚úÖ Solution: Added production domain to CDN allowed origins
- ‚úÖ Verified fix in production

**Decisions Made:**
- CORS configuration approach (see DECISIONS.md)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Profile images not loading in production
```

**Value:** Next time a similar issue occurs, you have the investigation and solution documented.

## Example 8: Refactoring Project

**Scenario:** Major refactoring - moving from Pages Router to App Router in Next.js.

### Step 1: Document the Plan

```
/save-context
```

**Captures in DECISIONS.md:**
```markdown
## Migration to App Router - 2025-10-04

**Decision:** Migrate from Pages Router to App Router (Next.js)

**Context:** App Router offers better performance, streaming, and is the future of Next.js

**Approach:**
- Phase 1: Create parallel app/ directory
- Phase 2: Migrate routes one by one
- Phase 3: Remove pages/ directory
- Duration: ~2 weeks

**When to Reconsider:**
- If App Router has critical bugs
- If migration takes >1 month
```

### Step 2: Track Progress

**After each migration session:**

```
/save-context
```

**Captures:**
- Which routes migrated
- Patterns learned
- Issues encountered
- Remaining work

### Step 3: Multiple Sessions

**Session 25:**
```
Migrated: Home page, About page
Pattern: Using RSC for data fetching
Issue: Auth middleware needs updating
```

**Session 26:**
```
Migrated: Blog pages, Profile pages
Solved: Auth middleware working with App Router
Remaining: Admin pages, API routes
```

**Session 27:**
```
Migrated: All remaining pages
Removed: pages/ directory
Complete: App Router migration done
```

### Step 4: Retrospective

After completion, SESSIONS.md shows complete timeline:
- What was migrated when
- Problems encountered
- Solutions found
- Total effort

**Value:** Future migrations have a playbook.

## Example 9: Learning New Technology

**Scenario:** Adding Stripe payments to your app, first time using Stripe.

### Step 1: Document Initial State

```
/save-context
```

**Captures:**
```markdown
**Starting:** Stripe integration for payments
**Knowledge:** Never used Stripe before
**Goal:** Implement checkout flow
```

### Step 2: Track Learning

**As you learn, make decisions:**

```
Decided to use Stripe Checkout (hosted) instead of Elements (embedded)
- Simpler integration
- PCI compliance handled by Stripe
- Good enough for MVP

Documented in DECISIONS.md
```

### Step 3: Capture Patterns

**As you implement:**

```
/save-context
```

**Captures in ARCHITECTURE.md:**
```markdown
### Payment Flow

1. User clicks "Subscribe"
2. Frontend calls /api/checkout/session
3. Backend creates Stripe Checkout Session
4. User redirected to Stripe-hosted checkout
5. Webhook receives payment confirmation
6. Database updated with subscription status

**Key Files:**
- app/api/checkout/session/route.ts - Create checkout
- app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts - Handle events
- lib/stripe.ts - Stripe client configuration
```

### Step 4: Document Learnings

**Captures gotchas in KNOWN_ISSUES.md or CODE_STYLE.md:**

```markdown
## Stripe Integration Patterns

**Webhook signature verification:**
ALWAYS verify webhook signatures. Use raw body, not parsed JSON.

**Test mode:**
Use test API keys until thoroughly tested. Production keys only after testing.

**Idempotency:**
Include idempotency keys for payment operations.
```

**Value:** Next Stripe integration (or helping teammate) is much faster.

## Common Patterns

### The Save-Early-Save-Often Pattern

```
Morning:        /review-context
While coding:   /quick-save-context (every 30-60 min)
After feature:  /save-context
End of day:     /save-context (even if just ran it)
```

### The Quality-Check Pattern

```
Feature done:    /save-context
Validation:      /validate-context
Deep review:     /code-review
Fix issues:      (new session)
Final check:     /save-context
```

### The Handoff Pattern

```
Current state:   /save-context
Validate:        /validate-context
Export:          /export-context
Share:           Send export file + instructions
```

### The Resume-After-Break Pattern

```
Review:          /review-context
Check gaps:      git log, git status
Update:          /save-context (if needed)
Verify:          /review-context (again)
Resume:          Start working
```

---

## Anti-Patterns (Don't Do This)

### ‚ùå Never Saving

**Bad:**
```
Code for 8 hours straight
Never run /save-context
Session crashes
Lose everything
```

**Good:**
```
/quick-save-context every 30 minutes
/save-context after major milestones
Never lose >30 minutes of work
```

### ‚ùå Saving Without Context

**Bad:**
```
/save-context
"update stuff"
```

**Good:**
```
/save-context
"Implemented user authentication with JWT tokens.
Created login/logout flows, added middleware for protected routes.
Decided to use 'jose' library over 'jsonwebtoken' for Edge compatibility."
```

### ‚ùå Skipping Review on Resume

**Bad:**
```
Open project after 2 weeks
Start coding immediately
Waste time re-learning context
```

**Good:**
```
/review-context
Read last session notes
Check WIP state
Resume efficiently
```

### ‚ùå Making Changes During Code Review

**Bad:**
```
/code-review
"Let me fix this real quick"
(breaks review process, mixes concerns)
```

**Good:**
```
/code-review
Read full report
/save-context (to capture current state)
Fix issues in new focused session
```

## Success Metrics

**You're using the system well when:**

‚úÖ New sessions start with `/review-context`
‚úÖ You save context every 30-60 minutes (quick or full)
‚úÖ Session ends always include `/save-context`
‚úÖ You can resume after weeks with high confidence
‚úÖ Team handoffs require minimal explanation
‚úÖ Git history and SESSIONS.md tell same story
‚úÖ WIP captures are detailed and actionable
‚úÖ Code reviews are thorough because no time pressure
‚úÖ Documentation drift is minimal (everything stays current)
‚úÖ You rarely repeat explanations to Claude

**The ultimate test:**
> "I can end any session abruptly, start a new session days later, run /review-context, and continue exactly where I left off without any re-explanation or context loss."

When this is true, you've mastered the system.

---

## Tips & Tricks

### Tip 1: Use Quick-Save for Active Work

Don't let `/save-context` feel heavy. Use `/quick-save-context` frequently during active coding. Full save at natural breakpoints.

### Tip 2: Descriptive Session Messages

When running `/save-context`, give Claude context:
- What you accomplished
- What decisions you made
- What you're about to start
- Any blockers or issues

### Tip 3: WIP is King

The most valuable part of `/save-context` is **Work In Progress** capture:
- Exact file and line number
- What you were doing
- Why you chose this approach
- What's next

### Tip 4: Review Before Major Decisions

Before architectural decisions, run `/review-context` to understand current state and past decisions.

### Tip 5: Validate Before Sharing

Always `/validate-context` before:
- Team handoffs
- Client demos
- Deployment
- Long breaks

### Tip 6: Commit After Save

Good pattern:
```
/save-context
git add .
git commit -m "Implemented feature X"
```

Git and context docs stay in sync.

### Tip 7: Use Code Review for Learning

Run `/code-review` on completed features to learn:
- What you could improve
- Patterns to adopt
- Anti-patterns to avoid

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Context feels stale"

**Solution:**
```
/save-context
```

Run it. Even if you think nothing changed.

### "Can't resume after long break"

**Solution:**
```
/review-context
git log --since="[last session date]"
/save-context (fill in gaps)
/review-context (verify)
```

### "Lost work to session crash"

**Solution:**
Check last `/quick-save-context` time. Resume from there.

**Prevention:**
More frequent quick-saves (every 15-30 min).

### "Documentation contradicts code"

**Solution:**
```
/save-context
```

Tell Claude what actually happened. It will update docs to match reality.

---

## Conclusion

The Claude Context System works best when:
- You save early and often
- You review at session start
- You capture detailed WIP
- You separate review from fixes
- You trust the process

**Remember:** The system is your safety net. Use it freely. Over-saving is impossible. Under-saving is risky.

Happy coding! üöÄ
