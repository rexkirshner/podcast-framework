# /save-full Command

**Comprehensive session documentation** - Creates detailed SESSIONS.md entry with mental models and decision rationale. Use before breaks, handoffs, or milestones.

**For regular session updates, use `/save` (2-3 minutes)**

**Philosophy:**
- Capture TodoWrite state for productivity tracking
- Extract mental models and decision rationale for AI agents
- Update what changed (not everything)
- Grow documentation when complexity demands

**Reference guide:** `.claude/docs/save-context-guide.md` (philosophy, examples, not a checklist)

## When to Use This Command

**Use /save-full (comprehensive) when:**
- Taking break >1 week
- Handing off to another agent/developer
- Major milestone completed
- Want detailed session history entry

**Frequency:** ~3-5 times per 20 sessions (occasional, not every session)

**Target time:** 10-15 minutes

**For regular sessions:** Use `/save` instead (2-3 minutes)

**Rule of thumb:** Most sessions use `/save`. Use `/save-full` when you need comprehensive documentation.

## What This Command Does

**Everything /save does:**
1. Updates STATUS.md (current tasks, blockers, next steps)
2. Auto-generates QUICK_REF.md (dashboard)

**PLUS comprehensive documentation:**
3. **Creates SESSIONS.md entry** - Structured 40-60 lines with:
   - What changed and why
   - Problem solved (issue, constraints, approach, rationale)
   - Mental models (current understanding, insights, gotchas)
   - Files modified (with context)
   - Work in progress (precise resume point)
   - TodoWrite state (completed vs. pending)
4. **Updates DECISIONS.md** - If significant decision made
5. **Optional: Exports JSON** - For multi-agent workflows (--with-json flag)

**Purpose:** Comprehensive context for AI agents to review, understand, and take over development.

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Verify Context Exists

```
If context/ folder missing:
- Automatically run /init-context first
- Then proceed with save

If context/ exists:
- Proceed to Step 2
```

### Step 2: Analyze What Changed

**Option A: Use Helper Script (Recommended)**

```bash
./scripts/save-context-helper.sh
```

This will:
- Auto-detect session number
- Gather git changes (log, status, diff)
- Pre-populate session template with file changes
- Create draft file: `context/.session-N-draft.md`
- You just fill in the [BRACKETED] placeholders (mental models, rationale)

**Option B: Manual Analysis**

Gather information about this session's work:

**Git Analysis:**
```bash
# What happened this session
git log --oneline -10
git status
git diff HEAD

# What's staged
git diff --cached
```

**Session Understanding:**
- What was the focus of this session?
- What files were modified/created?
- What decisions were made?
- What issues were discovered or fixed?
- What's incomplete (WIP)?

### Step 3: Update Core Files (Always)

These files ALWAYS get updated:

#### context/SESSIONS.md - Session History (Structured, Comprehensive)

**Auto-detect session number:**
```bash
LAST_SESSION=$(grep -c "^## Session" context/SESSIONS.md)
NEXT_SESSION=$((LAST_SESSION + 1))
```

**Write a comprehensive, structured session summary** (40-60 lines with depth for AI agents):
```markdown
## Session [N] | YYYY-MM-DD | [Phase Name]

**Duration:** [X]h | **Focus:** [Brief description] | **Status:** ‚úÖ/‚è≥

### Changed
- ‚úÖ [Key accomplishment 1 with context]
- ‚úÖ [Key accomplishment 2 with context]

### Problem Solved
**Issue:** [What problem did this session address?]
**Constraints:** [What limitations existed?]
**Approach:** [How did you solve it? What was your thinking?]
**Why this approach:** [Rationale for the chosen solution]

### Decisions
- **[Decision topic]:** [What and why] ‚Üí See DECISIONS.md [ID]

### Files
**NEW:** `path/to/file.ts:1-150` - [Purpose and key contents]
**MOD:** `path/to/file.tsx:123-145` - [What changed and why]
**DEL:** `path/to/old-file.ts` - [Why removed]

### Mental Models
**Current understanding:** [Explain your mental model of the system]
**Key insights:** [Insights AI agents should know]
**Gotchas discovered:** [Things that weren't obvious]

### Work In Progress
**Task:** [What's incomplete - be specific]
**Location:** `file.ts:145` in `functionName()`
**Current approach:** [Detailed mental model of what you're doing]
**Why this approach:** [Rationale]
**Next specific action:** [Exact next step]
**Context needed:** [What you need to remember to resume]

### TodoWrite State
**Captured from TodoWrite:**
- ‚úÖ [Completed todo 1]
- [ ] [Incomplete todo - in WIP]

### Next Session
**Priority:** [Most important next action]
**Blockers:** [None / List blockers with details]
```

**Critical for AI Agents:**
- Problem Solved section - shows your thinking process
- Mental Models section - AI understands your approach
- Decisions linked to DECISIONS.md - full rationale
- Structured but comprehensive (40-60 lines, not 10 or 190)

#### context/STATUS.md - Current State (Single Source of Truth)

**Always update:**
- Current phase/focus - reflect where you are now
- Active tasks - update from TodoWrite state
- Work in progress - detailed WIP from current session
- Recent accomplishments - what you completed this session
- Next session priorities - what to do next
- Blockers and recent decisions

**This is the canonical source for "what's happening now"**

#### context/DECISIONS.md - Decision Log (For AI Agents)

**Update when significant decisions made:**

If you made an important technical decision this session:
1. Check if it's already documented
2. If not, add new entry using template format:
   ```markdown
   ## D[ID] - [Decision Title]

   **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
   **Status:** Accepted
   **Session:** [N]

   ### Context
   [What problem? What constraints?]

   ### Decision
   [What did we decide?]

   ### Rationale
   [WHY this approach?]

   ### Alternatives Considered
   1. **[Alt 1]** - Pros/Cons/Why not

   ### Tradeoffs Accepted
   - ‚úÖ [What we gain]
   - ‚ùå [What we give up]

   ### When to Reconsider
   [Triggers for revisiting]

   **For AI agents:** [Additional context AI needs]
   ```

3. Update Active Decisions table
4. Link from SESSIONS.md entry

**Critical:** DECISIONS.md enables AI agents to understand WHY you made choices, not just WHAT you implemented.

### Step 4: Update Optional Files (If They Exist)

Only update these if the file already exists:

#### context/PRD.md (if exists)
**Update if:** Product vision/roadmap changed
**Skip if:** Just implementation work

#### context/ARCHITECTURE.md (if exists)
**Update if:** Architectural changes made, new system design decisions
**Skip if:** No design changes

**Note:** These are the only optional files in v1.8.0. Other documentation needs are covered by core files:
- Decisions ‚Üí DECISIONS.md (core file)
- Code style ‚Üí CONTEXT.md preferences
- Known issues ‚Üí STATUS.md blockers section

### Step 5: Auto-Generate QUICK_REF.md

**Always generate** - provides fast orientation dashboard:

```markdown
# Quick Reference

**Auto-generated by `/save-context`** - Do not edit manually

## Project: [Project Name]

**Current:** [Phase] | **Session:** [N] | **Progress:** [X%]

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** [e.g., Next.js 15]
- **Language:** [e.g., TypeScript]
- **Database:** [e.g., PostgreSQL]

## URLs

- **Production:** [URL]
- **Staging:** [URL]
- **Local:** [URL]
- **Repository:** [GitHub URL]

## Current Focus

**Phase:** [Phase name]
**Active Tasks:** [From STATUS.md]
**Next Priority:** [From STATUS.md]

## Quick Commands

```bash
[dev command]
[test command]
[build command]
```

## Context Navigation

- **Orientation:** `context/CONTEXT.md`
- **Current Status:** `context/STATUS.md`
- **Decision Log:** `context/DECISIONS.md`
- **Session History:** `context/SESSIONS.md`

---

**Last Updated:** [Timestamp]
**Next Session:** See STATUS.md ‚Üí Work In Progress
```

### Step 6: Suggest New Files (When Needed)

**On-demand enhancement** - suggest when complexity demands:

#### Check for ARCHITECTURE.md need:
```bash
FILE_COUNT=$(find src -type f 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
DIR_COUNT=$(find src -type d -maxdepth 2 2>/dev/null | wc -l)

if [ ! -f context/ARCHITECTURE.md ] && [ $FILE_COUNT -gt 20 ] && [ $DIR_COUNT -gt 5 ]; then
  echo "üìê Your architecture is getting complex (20+ files, 5+ directories)"
  echo "   Should I create ARCHITECTURE.md for AI agents to understand system design?"
  echo "   (y/n)"
fi
```

#### Check for PRD.md need:
Ask if:
- Product vision discussed multiple times
- Feature roadmap getting complex
- File doesn't exist yet

**Prompt:** "Product scope is expanding. Should I create PRD.md to document vision and roadmap for AI agent context?"

**v1.8.0 Note:** We only suggest ARCHITECTURE.md and PRD.md on-demand. DECISIONS.md is always created as core file #3.

### Step 7: Cross-Check Consistency

Quick verification that docs tell coherent story:
- Does STATUS.md reflect current reality?
- Are DECISIONS.md entries linked from SESSIONS.md?
- Is QUICK_REF.md accurate?
- Do files reference each other correctly?

If inconsistencies found ‚Üí fix them.

### Step 7.5: Export JSON for Multi-Agent Workflows (Optional)

**ACTION:** If user provided `--with-json` flag, export SESSIONS.md to machine-readable JSON:

```bash
if [ "$WITH_JSON" = "true" ]; then
  echo ""
  echo "üìä Exporting JSON..."
  ./scripts/export-sessions-json.sh
  echo "   ‚úÖ .sessions-data.json created"
fi
```

This creates `context/.sessions-data.json` with structured session history for:
- Multi-agent workflows (context handoff)
- External tooling and analytics
- Automated QA and reminders
- AI agent consumption without Markdown parsing

**Usage:** `/save-full --with-json` to include JSON export

**Note:** Optional - only run when you actually need JSON for automation/multi-agent workflows.

### Step 8: Report Updates

Clear, concise summary:

```
‚úÖ Comprehensive Save Complete - Session [N]

**Core Updates:**
- SESSIONS.md - Comprehensive session log (Problem Solved, Mental Models, WIP)
- STATUS.md - Updated current tasks, blockers, next priorities
- DECISIONS.md - [Documented Decision D[ID] / No new decisions]
- QUICK_REF.md - Auto-generated dashboard
- [.sessions-data.json - Machine-readable export (if --with-json used)]

**Optional Updates:**
- [ARCHITECTURE.md - Updated system design / Skipped]
- [PRD.md - Updated roadmap / Skipped]

**For AI Agents:**
- Mental models captured in SESSIONS.md
- Decision rationale in DECISIONS.md
- [Machine-readable JSON available in .sessions-data.json]
- Full context available for review/takeover

**Time Invested:** ~10-15 minutes (comprehensive documentation)

**Current Status:** [One-sentence project status]

**Next Session:**
- Use /save for quick updates (2-3 min)
- Use /save-full again before next break/handoff
```

## Important Guidelines

### Update Philosophy

**Dual purpose in mind:**
- **For you:** Capture TodoWrite state, update STATUS.md, quick recovery
- **For AI agents:** Mental models, decision rationale, comprehensive context
- Write good session summary (SESSIONS.md 40-60 lines with depth)
- Document decisions with WHY (DECISIONS.md critical for AI)
- Everything else is optional

**Be structured AND comprehensive:**
- Structured format (scannable sections)
- But include depth (mental models, rationale, constraints)
- Include file paths and line numbers
- Capture the "why" not just the "what"
- Document WIP state precisely with mental model
- **Structured ‚â† minimal** - AI agents need context

**Grow when needed:**
- Don't create files prematurely
- Suggest ARCHITECTURE/PRD when complexity warrants it
- DECISIONS.md is always core (AI agents need it)

**See:** `.claude/docs/save-context-guide.md` for philosophy, examples, best practices

### What to Always Capture

**Non-negotiable (Core Files):**
- **SESSIONS.md entry** - Comprehensive with mental models (40-60 lines)
- **STATUS.md update** - Current tasks, blockers, next priorities
- **DECISIONS.md entry** - If significant decisions made (WHY)
- **QUICK_REF.md** - Auto-generated dashboard
- **Work in progress** state - Exact resume point with mental model
- **TodoWrite state** - Capture what was completed vs. pending

**Critical for AI agents:**
- Mental models - How you understand the system
- Decision rationale - WHY you chose this approach
- Problem-solving approach - How you tackled the issue
- Constraints - What limitations existed
- Gotchas discovered - Things that weren't obvious

**Can skip:**
- Optional files that didn't change (PRD, ARCHITECTURE)
- Sections that have no updates

### Work-In-Progress Capture (Critical!)

**Be specific about WIP:**
```markdown
**Work In Progress:**
- Implementing JWT refresh logic in `lib/auth.ts:145`
- Current approach: Using jose library for verification
- Next: Add refresh endpoint at `app/api/auth/refresh/route.ts`
- Mental model: Refresh in httpOnly cookie, access in memory
```

**Not this:**
```markdown
**Work In Progress:**
- Working on authentication
```

**Why:** Future Claude (or you) needs exact context to resume.

## Difference from Old Approach

**Old way (v1.6.2):**
- 50-step checklist
- Update all 8 files every time
- Bureaucratic process
- "Documentation for documentation's sake"

**v1.7.0:**
- Write session summary
- Update what changed
- Minimal approach (2 files)

**New way (v1.8.0 - Dual Purpose):**
- **Write comprehensive session summary** (40-60 lines with mental models)
- **Capture TodoWrite state + mental models for AI agents**
- **Document decision rationale** (DECISIONS.md)
- Update core 3 files (CONTEXT, STATUS, DECISIONS)
- **Auto-generate QUICK_REF.md**
- Structured but comprehensive
- **Enable AI agent review and takeover**

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ SESSIONS.md has comprehensive, structured entry (40-60 lines)
‚úÖ Mental models captured for AI understanding
‚úÖ TodoWrite state preserved
‚úÖ WIP state captured precisely with mental model
‚úÖ STATUS.md updated as single source of truth
‚úÖ DECISIONS.md updated if significant decisions made
‚úÖ QUICK_REF.md auto-generated
‚úÖ Can resume seamlessly next session
‚úÖ **AI agents can review with full context**
‚úÖ **AI agents can take over development with understanding**

## Time Investment

- Simple session: 3-5 minutes (comprehensive SESSIONS.md + STATUS.md + QUICK_REF.md)
- Complex session with decisions: 5-8 minutes (+ DECISIONS.md entry)
- With new optional file: 8-12 minutes (create ARCHITECTURE/PRD)

**Worth every second** - enables perfect session continuity AND AI agent review/takeover.
