# /save-context Command

Update context documentation to accurately reflect the current state of the project. **Intelligent, not bureaucratic** - updates what changed, suggests growth when needed.

**Philosophy:** Write a good session summary. Update what matters. Grow documentation when complexity demands it.

**Reference guide:** `.claude/docs/save-context-guide.md` (philosophy, examples, not a checklist)

## When to Use This Command

**Always save:**
- At session end (non-negotiable!)
- Before breaks (even 5-minute breaks)
- After completing work
- After making decisions

**Frequently save:**
- Every 30-60 minutes during active work
- When switching tasks

**Rule of thumb:** If unsure, run it. Better to save too often than lose context.

## What This Command Does

**Smart approach:**
1. Analyzes what actually changed this session
2. Updates only the relevant files
3. **Suggests creating new files when complexity demands it**
4. Preserves work-in-progress state
5. Reports what changed

**Not a checklist. Not 50 steps. Just intelligent documentation.**

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Verify Context Exists

```
If context/ folder missing:
- Automatically run /init-context first
- Then proceed with save

If context/ exists:
- Proceed to Step 2
```

### Step 2: Analyze What Changed

Gather information about this session's work:

**Git Analysis:**
```bash
# What happened this session
git log --oneline -10
git status
git diff HEAD

# What's staged
git diff --cached
```

**Session Understanding:**
- What was the focus of this session?
- What files were modified/created?
- What decisions were made?
- What issues were discovered or fixed?
- What's incomplete (WIP)?

### Step 3: Update Core Files (Always)

These files ALWAYS get updated:

#### context/SESSIONS.md - Session History

**Auto-detect session number:**
```bash
LAST_SESSION=$(grep -c "^## Session" context/SESSIONS.md)
NEXT_SESSION=$((LAST_SESSION + 1))
```

**Write a GOOD session summary** (not a checklist - capture what matters):
```markdown
## Session [N] - YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

**Focus:** [What was this session about?]

**Accomplishments:**
- [What did we achieve?]
- [Include file paths: `src/file.ts:123`]

**Files Modified/Created:**
- `path/to/file.ts:123-145` - [What changed]
- `path/to/new-file.tsx` - [Purpose]

**Work In Progress:**
- [What's incomplete? Where exactly did we stop?]
- [Next specific action to take]

**Next Steps:**
- [What to do next session]
```

**The WIP section is CRITICAL** - be specific:
- Exact file and line number
- Current approach/mental model
- Next specific action
- Any context needed to resume

#### context/CLAUDE.md - Project Guide

**Update if changed:**
- Current status/phase
- Commands (if new scripts added)
- Critical path section:
  ```markdown
  **Current Status:** [One-sentence status]

  **Completed in Session [N]:**
  - ‚úÖ [Key accomplishment 1]
  - ‚úÖ [Key accomplishment 2]

  **Key Files Modified/Created:**
  - `path/to/file` - [What changed]

  **Next Steps:**
  1. [Immediate next action]
  ```

**Skip if:** No material changes to project context

#### context/tasks/next-steps.md - Action Items

**Update based on session:**
- Mark completed actions: [ ] ‚Üí [‚úÖ]
- Add new actions from current session
- Update blockers
- Refresh priorities

### Step 4: Update Optional Files (If They Exist)

Only update these if the file already exists:

#### context/PRD.md (if exists)
**Update if:** Product vision/roadmap changed
**Skip if:** Just implementation work

#### context/ARCHITECTURE.md (if exists)
**Update if:** Architectural changes made
**Skip if:** No design changes

#### context/DECISIONS.md (if exists)
**Update if:** Technical decisions made this session
**Skip if:** No significant choices

#### context/CODE_STYLE.md (if exists)
**Update if:** New patterns/standards adopted
**Skip if:** No style changes (most sessions)

#### context/KNOWN_ISSUES.md (if exists)
**Update if:** Issues discovered or fixed
**Skip if:** No issue changes

### Step 5: Suggest New Files (When Needed)

**Progressive enhancement** - suggest creating files when complexity demands:

#### Check for ARCHITECTURE.md need:
```bash
# Count source files
FILE_COUNT=$(find src -type f 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
DIR_COUNT=$(find src -type d -maxdepth 2 2>/dev/null | wc -l)

if [ ! -f context/ARCHITECTURE.md ] && [ $FILE_COUNT -gt 20 ] && [ $DIR_COUNT -gt 5 ]; then
  echo "üìê Your architecture is getting complex (20+ files, 5+ directories)"
  echo "   Should I create ARCHITECTURE.md to document system design?"
  echo "   (y/n)"
fi
```

#### Check for DECISIONS.md need:
Ask if:
- Discussed 3+ technical options/tradeoffs this session
- Made significant architectural choice
- File doesn't exist yet

**Prompt:** "We made several important technical decisions this session. Should I create DECISIONS.md to track them?"

#### Check for CODE_STYLE.md need:
Ask if:
- User mentioned code quality standards multiple times
- Discussed coding patterns/conventions
- File doesn't exist yet

**Prompt:** "You've mentioned code quality standards. Should I create CODE_STYLE.md to formalize them?"

#### Check for KNOWN_ISSUES.md need:
Ask if:
- Tracking 3+ bugs or limitations
- Issues mentioned across multiple sessions
- File doesn't exist yet

**Prompt:** "We're tracking several bugs/issues. Should I create KNOWN_ISSUES.md?"

#### Check for PRD.md need:
Ask if:
- Product vision discussed multiple times
- Feature roadmap getting complex
- File doesn't exist yet

**Prompt:** "Product scope is expanding. Should I create PRD.md to document vision and roadmap?"

### Step 6: Cross-Check Consistency

Quick verification that docs tell coherent story:
- Does CLAUDE.md status match reality?
- Do files reference each other correctly?
- Is SESSIONS.md complete?

If inconsistencies found ‚Üí fix them.

### Step 7: Report Updates

Clear, concise summary:

```
‚úÖ Context Updated - Session [N]

**Core Updates:**
- SESSIONS.md - Complete session log with WIP state
- CLAUDE.md - Updated critical path
- next-steps.md - 3 completed, 2 new actions

**Optional Updates:**
- DECISIONS.md - Documented [decision]
- KNOWN_ISSUES.md - Fixed 2 bugs, added 1 concern

**Current Status:** [One-sentence project status]

**Next Session:** [What to do next]
```

## Important Guidelines

### Update Philosophy

**Focus on what matters:**
- Write a good session summary (SESSIONS.md is key)
- Update project context if it changed (CLAUDE.md)
- Track action items (next-steps.md)
- Everything else is optional

**Be specific, not generic:**
- Include file paths and line numbers
- Capture the "why" not just the "what"
- Document WIP state precisely
- Make it scannable

**Grow when needed:**
- Don't create files prematurely
- Suggest new documentation when complexity warrants it
- Let user decide what's worth documenting

**See:** `.claude/docs/save-context-guide.md` for philosophy, examples, best practices

### What to Always Capture

**Non-negotiable:**
- SESSIONS.md entry (most important!)
- **Work in progress** state (exact resume point)
- Files modified (with what changed)
- Next actions

**If relevant:**
- Decisions made (with reasoning)
- Issues found/fixed (with severity)
- Status updates

**Can skip:**
- Files that didn't change
- Documentation that's not relevant
- Bureaucratic ceremony

### Work-In-Progress Capture (Critical!)

**Be specific about WIP:**
```markdown
**Work In Progress:**
- Implementing JWT refresh logic in `lib/auth.ts:145`
- Current approach: Using jose library for verification
- Next: Add refresh endpoint at `app/api/auth/refresh/route.ts`
- Mental model: Refresh in httpOnly cookie, access in memory
```

**Not this:**
```markdown
**Work In Progress:**
- Working on authentication
```

**Why:** Future Claude (or you) needs exact context to resume.

## Difference from Old Approach

**Old way (v1.6.2):**
- 50-step checklist
- Update all 8 files every time
- Bureaucratic process
- "Documentation for documentation's sake"

**New way (v1.7.0):**
- Write a good session summary
- Update what changed
- Suggest growth when needed
- "Document what matters"

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ SESSIONS.md has complete entry
‚úÖ WIP state captured precisely
‚úÖ CLAUDE.md reflects current status (if changed)
‚úÖ Next steps are clear
‚úÖ Can resume seamlessly next session
‚úÖ No unnecessary file updates

## Time Investment

- Simple session: 1-2 minutes (just SESSIONS.md + next-steps)
- Complex session: 3-5 minutes (multiple files updated)
- With new file creation: 5-7 minutes (create + populate)

**Worth every second** - enables perfect session continuity.
