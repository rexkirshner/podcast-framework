# /save-full Command

**Comprehensive session documentation** - Creates detailed SESSIONS.md entry with mental models and decision rationale. Use before breaks, handoffs, or milestones.

**For regular session updates, use `/save` (2-3 minutes)**

**Philosophy:**
- Capture TodoWrite state for productivity tracking
- Extract mental models and decision rationale for AI agents
- Update what changed (not everything)
- Grow documentation when complexity demands

**Reference guide:** `.claude/docs/save-context-guide.md` (philosophy, examples, not a checklist)

## When to Use This Command

**Use /save-full (comprehensive) when:**
- Taking break >1 week
- Handing off to another agent/developer
- Major milestone completed
- Want detailed session history entry

**Frequency:** ~3-5 times per 20 sessions (occasional, not every session)

**Target time:** 10-15 minutes

**For regular sessions:** Use `/save` instead (2-3 minutes)

**Rule of thumb:** Most sessions use `/save`. Use `/save-full` when you need comprehensive documentation.

## What This Command Does

**Everything /save does:**
1. Updates STATUS.md (current tasks, blockers, next steps)
2. Auto-generates Quick Reference section in STATUS.md (dashboard)

**PLUS comprehensive documentation:**
3. **Creates SESSIONS.md entry** - Structured 40-60 lines with:
   - What changed and why
   - Problem solved (issue, constraints, approach, rationale)
   - Mental models (current understanding, insights, gotchas)
   - Files modified (with context)
   - Work in progress (precise resume point)
   - TodoWrite state (completed vs. pending)
4. **Updates DECISIONS.md** - If significant decision made
5. **Optional: Exports JSON** - For multi-agent workflows (--with-json flag)

**Purpose:** Comprehensive context for AI agents to review, understand, and take over development.

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Verify Context Exists

```
If context/ folder missing:
- Automatically run /init-context first
- Then proceed with save

If context/ exists:
- Proceed to Step 2
```

### Step 2: Analyze What Changed

**Option A: Use Helper Script (Recommended)**

```bash
./scripts/save-context-helper.sh
```

This will:
- Auto-detect session number
- Gather git changes (log, status, diff)
- Pre-populate session template with file changes
- Create draft file: `context/.session-N-draft.md`
- You just fill in the [BRACKETED] placeholders (mental models, rationale)

**Option B: Manual Analysis**

Gather information about this session's work:

**Git Analysis:**
```bash
# What happened this session
git log --oneline -10
git status
git diff HEAD

# What's staged
git diff --cached
```

**Session Understanding:**
- What was the focus of this session?
- What files were modified/created?
- What decisions were made?
- What issues were discovered or fixed?
- What's incomplete (WIP)?

### Step 3: Update Core Files (Always)

These files ALWAYS get updated:

#### context/SESSIONS.md - Session History (Structured, Comprehensive)

**Auto-detect session number:**
```bash
LAST_SESSION=$(grep -c "^## Session" context/SESSIONS.md)
NEXT_SESSION=$((LAST_SESSION + 1))
```

**Write a comprehensive, structured session summary** (40-60 lines with depth for AI agents):
```markdown
## Session [N] | YYYY-MM-DD | [Phase Name]

**Duration:** [X]h | **Focus:** [Brief description] | **Status:** ‚úÖ/‚è≥

### Changed
- ‚úÖ [Key accomplishment 1 with context]
- ‚úÖ [Key accomplishment 2 with context]

### Problem Solved
**Issue:** [What problem did this session address?]
**Constraints:** [What limitations existed?]
**Approach:** [How did you solve it? What was your thinking?]
**Why this approach:** [Rationale for the chosen solution]

### Decisions
- **[Decision topic]:** [What and why] ‚Üí See DECISIONS.md [ID]

### Files
**NEW:** `path/to/file.ts:1-150` - [Purpose and key contents]
**MOD:** `path/to/file.tsx:123-145` - [What changed and why]
**DEL:** `path/to/old-file.ts` - [Why removed]

### Mental Models
**Current understanding:** [Explain your mental model of the system]
**Key insights:** [Insights AI agents should know]
**Gotchas discovered:** [Things that weren't obvious]

### Work In Progress
**Task:** [What's incomplete - be specific]
**Location:** `file.ts:145` in `functionName()`
**Current approach:** [Detailed mental model of what you're doing]
**Why this approach:** [Rationale]
**Next specific action:** [Exact next step]
**Context needed:** [What you need to remember to resume]

### TodoWrite State
**Captured from TodoWrite:**
- ‚úÖ [Completed todo 1]
- [ ] [Incomplete todo - in WIP]

### Next Session
**Priority:** [Most important next action]
**Blockers:** [None / List blockers with details]
```

**Critical for AI Agents:**
- Problem Solved section - shows your thinking process
- Mental Models section - AI understands your approach
- Decisions linked to DECISIONS.md - full rationale
- Structured but comprehensive (40-60 lines, not 10 or 190)

#### context/STATUS.md - Current State (Single Source of Truth)

**Always update:**
- Current phase/focus - reflect where you are now
- Active tasks - update from TodoWrite state
- Work in progress - detailed WIP from current session
- Recent accomplishments - what you completed this session
- Next session priorities - what to do next
- Blockers and recent decisions

**This is the canonical source for "what's happening now"**

#### context/DECISIONS.md - Decision Log (For AI Agents)

**Update when significant decisions made:**

If you made an important technical decision this session:
1. Check if it's already documented
2. If not, add new entry using template format:
   ```markdown
   ## D[ID] - [Decision Title]

   **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
   **Status:** Accepted
   **Session:** [N]

   ### Context
   [What problem? What constraints?]

   ### Decision
   [What did we decide?]

   ### Rationale
   [WHY this approach?]

   ### Alternatives Considered
   1. **[Alt 1]** - Pros/Cons/Why not

   ### Tradeoffs Accepted
   - ‚úÖ [What we gain]
   - ‚ùå [What we give up]

   ### When to Reconsider
   [Triggers for revisiting]

   **For AI agents:** [Additional context AI needs]
   ```

3. Update Active Decisions table
4. Link from SESSIONS.md entry

**Critical:** DECISIONS.md enables AI agents to understand WHY you made choices, not just WHAT you implemented.

### Step 4: Update Optional Files (If They Exist)

Only update these if the file already exists:

#### context/PRD.md (if exists)
**Update if:** Product vision/roadmap changed
**Skip if:** Just implementation work

#### context/ARCHITECTURE.md (if exists)
**Update if:** Architectural changes made, new system design decisions
**Skip if:** No design changes

**Note:** These are the only optional files in v1.8.0. Other documentation needs are covered by core files:
- Decisions ‚Üí DECISIONS.md (core file)
- Code style ‚Üí CONTEXT.md preferences
- Known issues ‚Üí STATUS.md blockers section

### Step 5: Update Quick Reference in STATUS.md

**Always update** - auto-generated dashboard section at top of STATUS.md:

**ACTION:** Use Edit tool to update the Quick Reference section in STATUS.md with current data from .context-config.json and STATUS.md content:

```bash
# Extract values from config and STATUS.md
PROJECT_NAME=$(jq -r '.project.name' context/.context-config.json)
CURRENT_PHASE=$(sed -n '/## Current Phase/,/^##/p' context/STATUS.md | grep "^**Phase:**" | sed 's/^**Phase:** //')
# ... (see /save command for full auto-population logic)

# Update Quick Reference section between markers in STATUS.md
# Section is between "## üìä Quick Reference" and next "---"
```

**Fields auto-populated:**
- Project name, URLs, tech stack ‚Üí from .context-config.json
- Current phase, status, active tasks ‚Üí from STATUS.md content
- Documentation health ‚Üí from last /validate-context run
- Last session ‚Üí from SESSIONS.md

**Note:** In v2.1.0, Quick Reference is a section IN STATUS.md, not a separate file.

### Step 6: Suggest New Files (When Needed)

**On-demand enhancement** - suggest when complexity demands:

#### Check for ARCHITECTURE.md need:
```bash
FILE_COUNT=$(find src -type f 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
DIR_COUNT=$(find src -type d -maxdepth 2 2>/dev/null | wc -l)

if [ ! -f context/ARCHITECTURE.md ] && [ $FILE_COUNT -gt 20 ] && [ $DIR_COUNT -gt 5 ]; then
  echo "üìê Your architecture is getting complex (20+ files, 5+ directories)"
  echo "   Should I create ARCHITECTURE.md for AI agents to understand system design?"
  echo "   (y/n)"
fi
```

#### Check for PRD.md need:
Ask if:
- Product vision discussed multiple times
- Feature roadmap getting complex
- File doesn't exist yet

**Prompt:** "Product scope is expanding. Should I create PRD.md to document vision and roadmap for AI agent context?"

**v1.8.0 Note:** We only suggest ARCHITECTURE.md and PRD.md on-demand. DECISIONS.md is always created as core file #3.

### Step 7: Cross-Check Consistency

Quick verification that docs tell coherent story:
- Does STATUS.md reflect current reality?
- Are DECISIONS.md entries linked from SESSIONS.md?
- Is Quick Reference section in STATUS.md auto-updated correctly?
- Do files reference each other correctly?

If inconsistencies found ‚Üí fix them.

### Step 7.5: Export JSON for Multi-Agent Workflows (Optional)

**ACTION:** If user provided `--with-json` flag, export SESSIONS.md to machine-readable JSON:

```bash
if [ "$WITH_JSON" = "true" ]; then
  echo ""
  echo "üìä Exporting JSON..."
  ./scripts/export-sessions-json.sh
  echo "   ‚úÖ .sessions-data.json created"
fi
```

This creates `context/.sessions-data.json` with structured session history for:
- Multi-agent workflows (context handoff)
- External tooling and analytics
- Automated QA and reminders
- AI agent consumption without Markdown parsing

**Usage:** `/save-full --with-json` to include JSON export

**Note:** Optional - only run when you actually need JSON for automation/multi-agent workflows.

### Step 7.6: Git Push Protection - MANDATORY CHECK

**üö® CRITICAL: Read this section before ANY git push operation**

**ACTION:** Before pushing to GitHub, verify explicit user approval using multi-layered checklist:

#### Layer 1: Check Configuration

```bash
# Read git push protection settings from .context-config.json
PUSH_PROTECTION=$(jq -r '.git.pushProtection.enabled' context/.context-config.json 2>/dev/null || echo "true")

if [ "$PUSH_PROTECTION" = "true" ]; then
  echo ""
  echo "üö®‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ"
  echo "   GIT PUSH PROTECTION - MANDATORY STOP"
  echo "‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ"
  echo ""
fi
```

#### Layer 2: Pre-Push Checklist (MANDATORY - Answer ALL)

```
üö® CHECKLIST - Answer ALL questions before proceeding:

1. Did user say "push" or "deploy" in their LAST message?
   [ ] Yes, user explicitly said to push
   [ ] No or unclear

2. Will this trigger a production deployment or consume build quota?
   [ ] Yes (requires approval)
   [ ] No

3. Do I have explicit permission for THIS SPECIFIC push?
   [ ] Yes, user approved in last message
   [ ] No or based on general workflow description

‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ

üìã DECISION LOGIC:

If ANY answer is "No" or "unclear":
  ‚úÖ STOP HERE
  ‚úÖ Commit changes locally: git commit -m "..."
  ‚úÖ Ask user: "Ready to push to GitHub? This will trigger [deployment/build]. Do you approve?"
  ‚úÖ Wait for explicit "yes" / "push" / "approved" response
  ‚úÖ Only then: git push

If ALL answers are "Yes":
  ‚úÖ Verify by re-reading user's exact message
  ‚úÖ Confirm approval is for THIS push (not a workflow description)
  ‚úÖ Extract approval quote for auto-logging (see below)
  ‚úÖ Then: git push

‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ

‚ö†Ô∏è  REMEMBER:
- General workflow instructions ‚â† permission for this specific push
- "Then push to GitHub" in instructions = workflow description, NOT approval
- ALWAYS ask explicitly before every push
- Auto-log approval if granted (see below)

‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
```

#### Layer 3: Auto-Log Git Operations (Codex #7)

**If git operations occurred this session, auto-populate Git Operations section in SESSIONS.md:**

```bash
# Count commits in this session (approximation using recent history)
COMMITS=$(git rev-list --count HEAD@{1}..HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "0")

# Detect if push occurred
PUSHED="NO"
APPROVAL="Not pushed"

# If push was executed:
if [ $PUSH_EXECUTED = true ]; then
  PUSHED="YES"

  # Extract approval quote from conversation
  # In actual implementation, this would parse the conversation log
  # For now, prompt to capture it:
  echo ""
  echo "üìù Git push executed. What was the user's approval message?"
  echo "   (Paste the exact quote where user approved the push):"
  read -r USER_APPROVAL

  APPROVAL="\"$USER_APPROVAL\" (user message)"
fi

# Add to SESSIONS.md entry in Git Operations section
echo ""
echo "### Git Operations"
echo "**MANDATORY - Auto-logged from conversation**"
echo ""
echo "- **Commits:** $COMMITS commits"
echo "- **Pushed:** $PUSHED"
echo "- **Approval:** $APPROVAL"
```

**Why auto-logging matters:**
- Removes manual copy-paste burden
- Ensures audit trail never missing
- Validates against git push protocol
- Reduces human error
- Provides evidence of approval compliance

#### Layer 4: Session Start Flag (for /review-context)

**At session start, set:**
```bash
PUSH_APPROVED=false
```

This flag must be explicitly set to true with user approval before ANY push.

**Approval phrases (from .context-config.json):**
- "push"
- "deploy"
- "go ahead and push"
- "yes push"

**NOT approval:**
- "save and push" in workflow description
- "then push" in instructions
- Any mention of push without explicit "do it now"

### Step 8: Report Updates

Clear, concise summary:

```
‚úÖ Comprehensive Save Complete - Session [N]

**Core Updates:**
- SESSIONS.md - Comprehensive session log (Problem Solved, Mental Models, WIP)
- STATUS.md - Updated current tasks, blockers, next priorities, Quick Reference (auto-generated)
- DECISIONS.md - [Documented Decision D[ID] / No new decisions]
- [.sessions-data.json - Machine-readable export (if --with-json used)]

**Optional Updates:**
- [ARCHITECTURE.md - Updated system design / Skipped]
- [PRD.md - Updated roadmap / Skipped]

**For AI Agents:**
- Mental models captured in SESSIONS.md
- Decision rationale in DECISIONS.md
- [Machine-readable JSON available in .sessions-data.json]
- Full context available for review/takeover

**Time Invested:** ~10-15 minutes (comprehensive documentation)

**Current Status:** [One-sentence project status]

**Next Session:**
- Use /save for quick updates (2-3 min)
- Use /save-full again before next break/handoff
```

## Important Guidelines

### Update Philosophy

**Dual purpose in mind:**
- **For you:** Capture TodoWrite state, update STATUS.md, quick recovery
- **For AI agents:** Mental models, decision rationale, comprehensive context
- Write good session summary (SESSIONS.md 40-60 lines with depth)
- Document decisions with WHY (DECISIONS.md critical for AI)
- Everything else is optional

**Be structured AND comprehensive:**
- Structured format (scannable sections)
- But include depth (mental models, rationale, constraints)
- Include file paths and line numbers
- Capture the "why" not just the "what"
- Document WIP state precisely with mental model
- **Structured ‚â† minimal** - AI agents need context

**Grow when needed:**
- Don't create files prematurely
- Suggest ARCHITECTURE/PRD when complexity warrants it
- DECISIONS.md is always core (AI agents need it)

**See:** `.claude/docs/save-context-guide.md` for philosophy, examples, best practices

### What to Always Capture

**Non-negotiable (Core Files):**
- **SESSIONS.md entry** - Comprehensive with mental models (40-60 lines)
- **STATUS.md update** - Current tasks, blockers, next priorities, Quick Reference section (auto-generated)
- **DECISIONS.md entry** - If significant decisions made (WHY)
- **Work in progress** state - Exact resume point with mental model
- **TodoWrite state** - Capture what was completed vs. pending

**Critical for AI agents:**
- Mental models - How you understand the system
- Decision rationale - WHY you chose this approach
- Problem-solving approach - How you tackled the issue
- Constraints - What limitations existed
- Gotchas discovered - Things that weren't obvious

**Can skip:**
- Optional files that didn't change (PRD, ARCHITECTURE)
- Sections that have no updates

### Work-In-Progress Capture (Critical!)

**Be specific about WIP:**
```markdown
**Work In Progress:**
- Implementing JWT refresh logic in `lib/auth.ts:145`
- Current approach: Using jose library for verification
- Next: Add refresh endpoint at `app/api/auth/refresh/route.ts`
- Mental model: Refresh in httpOnly cookie, access in memory
```

**Not this:**
```markdown
**Work In Progress:**
- Working on authentication
```

**Why:** Future Claude (or you) needs exact context to resume.

## Difference from Old Approach

**Old way (v1.6.2):**
- 50-step checklist
- Update all 8 files every time
- Bureaucratic process
- "Documentation for documentation's sake"

**v1.7.0:**
- Write session summary
- Update what changed
- Minimal approach (2 files)

**New way (v2.1.0 - Dual Purpose):**
- **Write comprehensive session summary** (40-60 lines with mental models, mandatory TL;DR)
- **Capture TodoWrite state + mental models for AI agents**
- **Document decision rationale** (DECISIONS.md)
- Update core 4 files (claude.md, CONTEXT, STATUS with auto-generated Quick Reference, DECISIONS)
- **Auto-generate Quick Reference section in STATUS.md**
- Structured but comprehensive
- **Enable AI agent review and takeover**
- **Auto-log git operations** for audit trail

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ SESSIONS.md has comprehensive, structured entry (40-60 lines with mandatory TL;DR)
‚úÖ Mental models captured for AI understanding
‚úÖ TodoWrite state preserved
‚úÖ WIP state captured precisely with mental model
‚úÖ STATUS.md updated as single source of truth
‚úÖ Quick Reference section in STATUS.md auto-generated
‚úÖ DECISIONS.md updated if significant decisions made
‚úÖ Git operations auto-logged in SESSIONS.md
‚úÖ Can resume seamlessly next session
‚úÖ **AI agents can review with full context**
‚úÖ **AI agents can take over development with understanding**

## Time Investment

- Simple session: 3-5 minutes (comprehensive SESSIONS.md + STATUS.md with Quick Reference)
- Complex session with decisions: 5-8 minutes (+ DECISIONS.md entry)
- With new optional file: 8-12 minutes (create ARCHITECTURE/PRD/CODE_MAP)

**Worth every second** - enables perfect session continuity AND AI agent review/takeover.
