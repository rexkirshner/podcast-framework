# /update-context-system Command

Update your project's Claude Context System to the latest version from GitHub. Safely updates commands and optionally updates context file templates.

**Full guide:** `.claude/docs/update-guide.md` - Philosophy, troubleshooting, best practices

## When to Use This Command

- Periodically (monthly) to get latest improvements
- When new features or bug fixes are released
- Before initializing new projects (get latest templates)

**See:** `.claude/docs/update-guide.md` - "When To Update"

**Run periodically** to stay up to date with improvements.

## What This Command Does

1. Fetches latest version from GitHub
2. Updates all slash commands (`.claude/commands/*.md`)
3. Detects changes to context file templates
4. Optionally updates context files with new sections
5. Reports everything that changed

## Command Options

### Default (Interactive Mode)
```
/update-context-system
```
- Updates commands automatically
- Shows diffs for context file changes
- Asks for approval before applying each change
- Safe, controlled updates

### Accept All Mode
```
/update-context-system --accept-all
```
- Updates commands automatically
- Applies all context file updates without review
- Fast, fully automated
- Use when you trust all updates

## Important: How to Execute This Command

**CRITICAL:** You MUST use the Bash tool to execute all commands in this file. Do NOT describe the commands to the user - EXECUTE them.

Each bash code block in this file should be run using the Bash tool. This is an automated update process.

**CRITICAL WORKING DIRECTORY RULE:**
- User will run this command FROM the project directory
- Do NOT try to cd into the project directory yourself
- All paths in commands are relative to project root
- If Step 0 fails, tell user to cd to correct directory
- Do NOT attempt complex path escaping with spaces
- Trust that user's current directory is correct when they run the command

## Important: Version Check First

**CRITICAL:** This command compares version numbers. If local version matches GitHub version, the command MUST exit immediately without making ANY changes. Only proceed with updates if GitHub version is newer.

## Execution Steps

### Step 0: Verify Working Directory

**CRITICAL:** Ensure we're in the correct project directory before proceeding.

```bash
# Check if context/.context-config.json exists
if [ ! -f "context/.context-config.json" ]; then
  echo ""
  echo "‚ùå ERROR: Not in correct project directory"
  echo ""
  echo "Current directory: $(pwd)"
  echo ""
  echo "This command must be run from the project root directory that contains:"
  echo "  - context/.context-config.json"
  echo "  - .claude/commands/"
  echo ""
  echo "Common issues:"
  echo "  1. Running from parent folder instead of project folder"
  echo "  2. Running from nested subdirectory"
  echo ""

  # Try to detect if we're in a parent folder
  if [ -d "inevitable-eth/context" ] || [ -d "*/context" ]; then
    echo "üí° Detected project in subdirectory!"
    echo ""
    echo "Try:"
    echo "  cd inevitable-eth  (or whatever your project folder is)"
    echo "  /update-context-system"
  fi

  echo ""
  echo "Cancelled. Please cd to the project directory and try again."
  exit 1
fi

echo "‚úÖ Working directory verified"
echo "Project: $(pwd)"
echo ""
```

### Step 1: Check Current Version and Download Latest

**ACTION:** Use the Bash tool to execute these steps:

**Step 1a: Get current version**
```bash
CURRENT_VERSION=$(grep -m 1 '"version":' context/.context-config.json | cut -d'"' -f4)
echo "üì¶ Current version: $CURRENT_VERSION"
echo "üîç Checking for updates from GitHub..."
```

**Step 1b: Download and extract latest**
```bash
rm -rf /tmp/claude-context-update
mkdir -p /tmp/claude-context-update
curl -f -L https://github.com/rexkirshner/claude-context-system/archive/refs/heads/main.zip -o /tmp/claude-context-update/latest.zip

# Verify download succeeded
if [ ! -f /tmp/claude-context-update/latest.zip ] || [ ! -s /tmp/claude-context-update/latest.zip ]; then
  echo "‚ùå ERROR: Download failed. Check your internet connection and try again."
  rm -rf /tmp/claude-context-update
  exit 1
fi

unzip -q /tmp/claude-context-update/latest.zip -d /tmp/claude-context-update
```

**Step 1c: Get latest version and compare**
```bash
LATEST_VERSION=$(grep -m 1 '"version":' /tmp/claude-context-update/claude-context-system-main/config/.context-config.template.json | cut -d'"' -f4)
CURRENT_VERSION=$(grep -m 1 '"version":' context/.context-config.json | cut -d'"' -f4)

echo "üîç Latest version from GitHub: $LATEST_VERSION"
echo ""

if [ "$CURRENT_VERSION" = "$LATEST_VERSION" ]; then
  echo "‚úÖ Already Up to Date"
  echo ""
  echo "Current version: $CURRENT_VERSION"
  echo "Latest version: $LATEST_VERSION"
  echo ""
  echo "Your Claude Context System is already running the latest version."
  echo "No updates were performed. All commands are current."

  rm -rf /tmp/claude-context-update
  echo "STOP_NO_UPDATE"
else
  echo "üì¶ Update Available"
  echo "  Current: $CURRENT_VERSION"
  echo "  Latest:  $LATEST_VERSION"
  echo ""
  echo "Proceeding with update..."
  echo "PROCEED_WITH_UPDATE"
fi
```

**After running the above:**
- If output contains "STOP_NO_UPDATE": Exit immediately, do not proceed to Step 3
- If output contains "PROCEED_WITH_UPDATE": Continue to Step 3

**CRITICAL:** If versions match, exit BEFORE updating commands. Do not download, do not copy files, do not modify anything. Only proceed if latest > current.

The version check MUST use string comparison (`[ "$CURRENT_VERSION" = "$LATEST_VERSION" ]`) and exit immediately if they match.

### Step 3: Update Slash Commands

**ACTION:** Use the Bash tool to update the commands:

```bash
# Capture project root before any directory changes
PROJECT_ROOT=$(pwd)

# Check if .claude/commands/ exists (local installation)
if [ -d ".claude/commands" ]; then
  # Backup existing commands
  cp -r .claude/commands .claude/commands.backup

  # Update with latest
  cp /tmp/claude-context-update/claude-context-system-main/.claude/commands/* .claude/commands/

  # Report
  echo "‚úÖ Updated local commands:"
  ls .claude/commands/*.md | sed 's/.*\//  - /'
else
  # Commands are managed globally
  echo "üìù Note: This project uses global .claude/commands/ directory"
  echo "   Slash commands are managed globally by Claude Code"
  echo "   Commands will be updated from the claude-context-system home directory"
  echo ""
  echo "‚úÖ Proceeding with version and template updates..."
fi
```

**Commands updated:**
- init-context.md
- migrate-context.md
- save-context.md
- review-context.md
- code-review.md
- update-context-system.md (this command!)

### Step 3.5: Reload This Command (Self-Update)

**CRITICAL:** The update-context-system.md command file was just updated in Step 3. The newly downloaded version may have improved logic for detecting and applying template updates.

To ensure we use the **LATEST** command logic for remaining steps, we must reload this command now.

**ACTION:** Use the Read tool to read the newly updated command file:

```
Read file: .claude/commands/update-context-system.md
```

**After reading the new file:**

1. **Check if Step 4 logic has changed** - Compare what you just read with the Step 4 instructions you were originally following
2. **If Step 4 is different:** Continue execution using the **NEWLY READ** Step 4 instructions from the updated file
3. **If Step 4 is the same:** Continue with current instructions (no functional change)

**Example scenarios:**

- **Scenario A:** Old Step 4 used section-based detection (`sed -n '/^## Section/'`), new Step 4 uses content-based detection (`grep -A N '^**Marker:**'`)
  - **Action:** Use the new content-based approach for remaining execution

- **Scenario B:** Step 4 logic is identical in both versions
  - **Action:** Continue normally (no change needed)

**Why this matters:**

Without this reload step, you'd be executing outdated Step 4 logic even though the new file was downloaded. This reload ensures:
- Bug fixes in Step 4 take effect immediately (don't need two runs)
- New template detection features work on first run
- Self-updating command actually updates its own behavior

**After reload, proceed to Step 4 below** (using the version from the newly read file if different).

### Step 4: Detect Template Content Changes

**IMPORTANT:** This is a general-purpose template synchronization system that compares ALL sections in template files against project files.

**Philosophy:**
- Check every section in every template file
- If section exists and is identical ‚Üí Skip
- If section exists but differs ‚Üí Ask user to approve update
- If section is missing from project ‚Üí Ask user to approve adding it
- **ALWAYS ask user for approval** - never auto-apply (safety first)
- **Never touch project-specific sections** - use explicit blacklist

**Template files to check:**
1. `CLAUDE.template.md` ‚Üí `context/CLAUDE.md`
2. `CODE_STYLE.template.md` ‚Üí `context/CODE_STYLE.md` (if exists)
3. `ARCHITECTURE.template.md` ‚Üí `context/ARCHITECTURE.md` (if exists)

**Project-specific sections (NEVER update):**
- CLAUDE.md: Project Overview, Commands, Architecture, Development Status, Important Notes, Critical Path, Examples from Past Sessions
- CODE_STYLE.md: Project-specific rules, File Structure, Component Patterns, project examples
- ARCHITECTURE.md: Overview, System Architecture, Data Flow, Components, Dependencies (anything describing actual project)

**System sections (updatable with approval):**
- CLAUDE.md: Working with You, Communication Style, Core Development Methodology
- CODE_STYLE.md: General Principles, Code Quality Standards, Testing Requirements, Documentation Standards
- ARCHITECTURE.md: Documentation Guidelines, Best Practices

**ACTION:** Use the Bash tool to run this entire script as ONE command:

```bash
cd /tmp/claude-context-update/claude-context-system-main

echo "üîç Scanning template files for system section updates..."
echo ""

# Project-specific section blacklist (regex patterns)
BLACKLIST_CLAUDE="(Project Overview|Commands|Architecture|Development Status|Important Notes|Critical Path|Examples from Past Sessions)"
BLACKLIST_CODE_STYLE="(File Structure|Component Patterns)"
BLACKLIST_ARCHITECTURE="(Overview|System Architecture|Data Flow|Components|Dependencies)"

# Function to extract all ## sections from a file
get_sections() {
  local file="$1"
  grep '^## ' "$file" | sed 's/^## //'
}

# Function to extract a specific section (## to next ##)
extract_section() {
  local file="$1"
  local section="$2"
  awk -v section="$section" '
    /^## / {
      if (found == 1) exit;
      if ($0 ~ "^## " section "$") { found=1; print; next; }
    }
    found == 1 { print }
  ' "$file"
}

UPDATES_FOUND=0

# Check CLAUDE.template.md
echo "üìÑ Checking CLAUDE.template.md..."
cd - > /dev/null

if [ -f "context/CLAUDE.md" ]; then
  cd /tmp/claude-context-update/claude-context-system-main
  TEMPLATE_SECTIONS=$(get_sections "templates/CLAUDE.template.md")

  while IFS= read -r section; do
    # Skip if blacklisted (project-specific)
    if echo "$section" | grep -qE "$BLACKLIST_CLAUDE"; then
      continue
    fi

    cd - > /dev/null

    # Check if section exists in project
    if grep -q "^## $section$" context/CLAUDE.md; then
      # Section exists - compare content
      cd /tmp/claude-context-update/claude-context-system-main
      TEMPLATE_CONTENT=$(extract_section "templates/CLAUDE.template.md" "$section")
      cd - > /dev/null
      CURRENT_CONTENT=$(extract_section "context/CLAUDE.md" "$section")

      if [ "$TEMPLATE_CONTENT" != "$CURRENT_CONTENT" ]; then
        echo "  ‚ú® CHANGED: $section"
        UPDATES_FOUND=$((UPDATES_FOUND + 1))
        echo "SECTION_CHANGED|CLAUDE.md|$section"
      fi
    else
      # Section missing from project
      echo "  ‚ûï MISSING: $section"
      UPDATES_FOUND=$((UPDATES_FOUND + 1))
      echo "SECTION_MISSING|CLAUDE.md|$section"
    fi

    cd /tmp/claude-context-update/claude-context-system-main
  done <<< "$TEMPLATE_SECTIONS"
fi

cd - > /dev/null
echo ""

# Summary
if [ $UPDATES_FOUND -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "üìù Found $UPDATES_FOUND section update(s) across template files"
  echo ""
  echo "Markers output above (SECTION_CHANGED or SECTION_MISSING)"
  echo "Claude will ask for approval for each change"
else
  echo "‚úÖ All system sections are up to date"
fi
```

**After the script completes, you MUST take these actions immediately:**

**For EACH marker line (SECTION_CHANGED or SECTION_MISSING):**

The marker format is: `SECTION_CHANGED|<filename>|<section name>` or `SECTION_MISSING|<filename>|<section name>`

**CRITICAL:** You MUST ask the user for approval for EACH section update. Process them ONE AT A TIME.

**For SECTION_CHANGED markers:**

1. **Extract both versions for comparison:**
   - **ACTION:** Use Read tool to read the template section:
     ```bash
     cd /tmp/claude-context-update/claude-context-system-main
     awk -v section="<section name>" '/^## / { if (found == 1) exit; if ($0 ~ "^## " section "$") { found=1; print; next; } } found == 1 { print }' templates/CLAUDE.template.md > /tmp/template-section.txt
     ```
   - **ACTION:** Use Read tool to read the current project section:
     ```bash
     awk -v section="<section name>" '/^## / { if (found == 1) exit; if ($0 ~ "^## " section "$") { found=1; print; next; } } found == 1 { print }' context/CLAUDE.md > /tmp/current-section.txt
     ```
   - **ACTION:** Use Read tool to read both `/tmp/template-section.txt` and `/tmp/current-section.txt`

2. **Show diff to user and ask for approval:**
   ```
   üìù Template Update: <section name> in <filename>

   The template version of this section has changed.

   [Show both versions or key differences]

   Apply this update? [Y/n]

   Note: Your project-specific content will be preserved.
   ```

3. **If user approves (Y or yes):**
   - **ACTION:** Use Edit tool to replace the section:
     ```
     file_path: context/<filename>
     old_string: [entire current section including "## <section name>" header]
     new_string: [entire template section from /tmp/template-section.txt]
     ```
   - Report: "‚úÖ Updated '<section name>' in context/<filename>"

4. **If user declines (n or no):**
   - Report: "‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped '<section name>' update - keeping current version"

**For SECTION_MISSING markers:**

1. **Extract template section:**
   - **ACTION:** Use Read tool to read `/tmp/template-section.txt` (from previous extraction)
   - Or run extraction if not already done

2. **Ask user for approval:**
   ```
   ‚ûï New Section Available: <section name> in <filename>

   The template includes a system section that's missing from your project.

   [Show section content preview]

   Add this section to your project? [Y/n]
   ```

3. **If user approves (Y or yes):**
   - **ACTION:** Determine best insertion point (after last ## section or at end)
   - **ACTION:** Use Edit tool to add the section
   - Report: "‚úÖ Added '<section name>' to context/<filename>"

4. **If user declines (n or no):**
   - Report: "‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped adding '<section name>' - not needed for this project"

**If NO markers appear (script shows "All system sections are up to date"):**

Report:
```
‚úÖ All system sections are up to date
   No template changes to apply
```

**CRITICAL NOTES:**
- Process markers sequentially - do not batch them
- ALWAYS ask user before making changes
- Show clear before/after or diff when possible
- Never assume user wants the update
- If unsure, ask for clarification

### Step 5: Detect Context File Template Changes

Check which templates have changed:

```bash
# For each template, check if different from current
cd /tmp/claude-context-update/claude-context-system-main

# Check CLAUDE template
if [ -f templates/CLAUDE.template.md ]; then
  # Extract just the "system" sections we might want to update
  # (Communication Style, Core Methodology, etc.)
fi
```

**Sections we can safely update in CLAUDE.md:**
- "Core Development Methodology" (system section)
- Communication preferences template (system section)
- Reference to .context-config.json (system section)

**Sections we should NOT touch:**
- Project Overview (project-specific)
- Commands (project-specific)
- Architecture (project-specific)
- Examples from Past Sessions (project-specific)

**Identify available updates:**
```
Available template updates:
- CLAUDE.md: Core Development Methodology section updated
- CODE_STYLE.md: New anti-patterns added
- templates/: 2 new templates available
```

### Step 6: Detect User Modifications (Conflict Check)

**Before applying updates, check if user has customized system sections:**

```bash
# For each section we want to update, check if it's been modified
cd /tmp/claude-context-update/claude-context-system-main

# Extract Core Development Methodology from template
TEMPLATE_HASH=$(sed -n '/^## Core Development Methodology/,/^## /p' templates/CLAUDE.template.md | md5sum | cut -d' ' -f1)

# Extract from current project (if exists)
if grep -q "^## Core Development Methodology" context/CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null; then
  CURRENT_HASH=$(sed -n '/^## Core Development Methodology/,/^## /p' context/CLAUDE.md | md5sum | cut -d' ' -f1)

  # Compare with original v1.0.0 template hash
  ORIGINAL_HASH="[known hash for v1.0.0]"

  if [ "$CURRENT_HASH" != "$ORIGINAL_HASH" ] && [ "$CURRENT_HASH" != "$TEMPLATE_HASH" ]; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  CUSTOMIZATION DETECTED"
    echo "You've modified Core Development Methodology section"
    echo "Template has also been updated"
    echo ""
    echo "Options:"
    echo "1. Keep your customizations (skip update)"
    echo "2. Apply template update (overwrite customizations)"
    echo "3. Merge manually (show both versions)"
  fi
fi
```

**Conflict scenarios:**

1. **No conflict:** Current matches original template ‚Üí Safe to update
2. **User customized:** Current differs from original ‚Üí Warn before updating
3. **Both changed:** User customized AND template updated ‚Üí Require manual merge

**Handle conflicts:**

```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Conflict Detected in context/CLAUDE.md

Section: Core Development Methodology
Status: You've customized this section, and template has updates

--- YOUR VERSION ---
**When Debugging:**
Trace code flows carefully. Use debugger breakpoints.
Always check database state.

--- TEMPLATE UPDATE ---
**When Debugging:**
Trace through the ENTIRE code flow step by step. No assumptions. No shortcuts. Follow the data from entry point to the issue.

--- RECOMMENDATION ---
Your version includes custom debugging steps (database state check).
Template update adds emphasis on thoroughness.

Choose action:
1. Keep yours (recommended if you've added project-specific guidance)
2. Use template (recommended if you want latest best practices)
3. Merge both (manually combine in next step)
4. Show full diff

Your choice [1/2/3/4]:
```

### Step 7: Apply Updates (Based on Mode)

#### If `--accept-all` flag:

**Check for conflicts first:**
- If conflicts detected: Show warning, require manual resolution
- If no conflicts: Proceed with auto-apply

```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Cannot use --accept-all with conflicts

Conflicts detected in:
- context/CLAUDE.md (Core Development Methodology customized)
- context/CODE_STYLE.md (Git workflow customized)

Please run without --accept-all to resolve conflicts interactively.
Or resolve manually and re-run.
```

**If no conflicts, auto-apply all updates:**
1. Add/update Core Development Methodology in context/CLAUDE.md
2. Add/update system sections in context/CODE_STYLE.md
3. Update context/.context-config.json version
4. Report what was changed

```
üöÄ Applying all updates automatically...

‚úÖ Updated context/CLAUDE.md:
   - Core Development Methodology section updated
   - Communication preferences updated

‚úÖ Updated context/CODE_STYLE.md:
   - Added new anti-patterns section

‚úÖ Updated context/.context-config.json:
   - Version: 1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.2.0
```

#### If interactive mode (default):

**Show each update and ask:**

```
üìù Update available for context/CLAUDE.md

Section: Core Development Methodology
Change: Updated debugging guidance

--- OLD ---
**When Debugging:**
Trace through code flows carefully.

--- NEW ---
**When Debugging:**
Trace through the ENTIRE code flow step by step. No assumptions. No shortcuts. Follow the data from entry point to the issue.

Apply this update? [Y/n/diff]
- Y: Apply update
- n: Skip this update
- diff: Show full diff

User response: Y

‚úÖ Applied update to context/CLAUDE.md
```

**For each template update:**
1. Show section name and brief change summary
2. Show before/after snippet
3. Ask: Apply? [Y/n/diff]
4. If Y: Use Edit tool to apply change
5. If n: Skip, note in report
6. If diff: Show full diff, then ask again

### Step 8: Update Version in Config

**ACTION:** Use the Edit tool to update the version in context/.context-config.json

After determining LATEST_VERSION from Step 1, use the Edit tool:
```
file_path: context/.context-config.json
old_string: "version": "1.0.0"  (or whatever CURRENT_VERSION was)
new_string: "version": "1.1.1"  (or whatever LATEST_VERSION is)
```

Then report:
```
‚úÖ Updated version: 1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.1.1
```

### Step 9: Generate Update Report

Provide clear summary (dynamically generate based on actual changes):

```
‚úÖ Claude Context System Updated

## Version
[CURRENT_VERSION] ‚Üí [LATEST_VERSION]

## Commands Updated ([count])
[List all updated command files dynamically from Step 3]

## Context Files Updated ([count])
[List files that were actually updated in Step 4]

## Context Files Skipped ([count])
[List files that were skipped or had no changes]

## What's New in [LATEST_VERSION]
[Check if this is a major upgrade and show relevant info]
```

**Special messaging for v1.7.0 upgrades:**

If upgrading to v1.7.0 (from 1.6.2 or earlier), add this note:

```
üìã Important Changes in v1.7.0:

**Progressive Enhancement Approach:**
- /init-context now creates minimal setup (3 files) for NEW projects
- /init-context-full added for comprehensive setup (old behavior)
- /save-context now intelligent (updates what changed, not everything)
- Your existing project is unaffected - all files remain intact

**What this means for you:**
- Your current 8-file setup continues to work perfectly
- /save-context will be smarter (updates only what changed)
- New command /init-context-full available if needed
- See CHANGELOG: Real-world feedback drove these improvements

**No action required** - your project continues with its current structure.
```

**For all updates, end with:**

```
## Next Steps
1. Review updated sections in context docs
2. Run /save-context to capture the update
3. Continue working with latest system!

```

### Step 10: Cleanup

**CRITICAL:** This MUST be the final step. Do not run cleanup before template detection steps.

**ACTION:** Use the Bash tool to clean up:

```bash
# Remove temp directory (contains downloaded templates)
rm -rf /tmp/claude-context-update

# Remove command backup if it exists
if [ -d ".claude/commands.backup" ]; then
  rm -rf .claude/commands.backup
  echo "‚úÖ Removed command backup"
fi

echo "‚úÖ Cleanup complete"
```

**Why cleanup is last:**
- Steps 4-7 need /tmp/claude-context-update to access template files
- Running cleanup earlier causes template detection to fail (directory not found)
- This was a critical bug in v1.2.5 and earlier

## Template Section Mapping

These are the "system" sections we can safely update:

### context/CLAUDE.md
**Safe to update (system sections):**
- Core Development Methodology
- Communication Style template
- Testing & Verification template
- Config reference block

**Never touch (project sections):**
- Project Overview
- Commands
- Architecture
- Critical Path
- Examples from Past Sessions

### context/CODE_STYLE.md
**Safe to update (system sections):**
- Core development principles
- Anti-patterns
- Git workflow rules

**Never touch (project sections):**
- Language-specific conventions
- Project-specific patterns
- Custom testing requirements

### context/.context-config.json
**Safe to update:**
- version number
- Add new preference fields (don't remove existing)

**Never touch:**
- project.name, project.type
- Any user-customized preferences

## Update Detection Strategy

**How to detect if a section needs updating:**

1. **Hash comparison:**
   ```bash
   # Get hash of current section
   sed -n '/^## Core Development Methodology/,/^## /p' context/CLAUDE.md | md5sum

   # Compare with template
   sed -n '/^## Core Development Methodology/,/^## /p' templates/CLAUDE.template.md | md5sum
   ```

2. **If hashes differ:**
   - Section has been updated
   - Show diff and offer to apply

3. **If section missing entirely:**
   - Auto-add (this is an improvement, not a change)

## Error Handling

**If GitHub is unreachable:**
```
‚ùå Cannot reach GitHub
- Check internet connection
- Try again later
- Manual update: download from https://github.com/rexkirshner/claude-context-system
```

**If commands backup fails:**
```
‚ùå Could not backup existing commands
- Ensure .claude/commands/ is writable
- Check disk space
- Update cancelled for safety
```

**If template extraction fails:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Could not extract template updates
- Commands updated successfully
- Context file updates skipped
- Manually check templates/ folder
```

**If Edit tool fails:**
```
‚ùå Could not apply update to context/CLAUDE.md
- Changes saved to context/CLAUDE.md.update
- Review and apply manually
- Or re-run /update-context-system
```

## Important Notes

### Version Numbers
- Version stored in `context/.context-config.json`
- Format: `major.minor.patch` (e.g., "1.2.3")
- Check GitHub releases for changelog

### Backup Safety
- Commands backed up to `.claude/commands.backup` during update
- Restore if needed: `mv .claude/commands.backup .claude/commands`
- Backup removed on successful completion

### What Gets Updated
- ‚úÖ All slash commands (always)
- ‚úÖ System sections in context files (if changed)
- ‚úÖ Version number in config
- ‚ùå Never: project-specific content
- ‚ùå Never: custom user modifications

### Accept All Safety
- `--accept-all` only updates predefined system sections
- Never overwrites project-specific content
- Safe to use if you trust system updates
- Review changelog first: https://github.com/rexkirshner/claude-context-system/releases
