# PRD-proposal-v1 Codex Suggestions

## Executive Summary & Scope
- Clarify the distinction between the archival Strange Water relaunch and the reusable framework goal; explicitly call out how lessons from the Strange Water rollout feed into the template for future shows.
- Add a crisp articulation of the primary audience segments (listeners, prospective guests, partners) and the business goals tied to each so the rest of the document can trace requirements back to them.
- Capture what is intentionally out of scope for the first release (e.g., paid membership, full community features) to reduce ambiguity in later phases.
- Introduce KPIs that measure the framework’s reusability (time to spin up a new show, configuration effort, launch checklist completion) alongside the site-level SEO metrics already listed.

## Personas, Journeys & Content Operations
- Create lightweight personas for the core operators (host, producer, junior coordinator) and map their end-to-end workflows (episode prep → publishing → promotion) to validate that the CMS and tooling choices meet their needs.
- Document the editorial workflow expected in Sanity (draft, review, publish, rollback) and any roles/permissions so you can validate CMS configuration against real processes.
- Specify content governance policies—naming conventions, metadata completeness, asset specs, and approval cadences—to keep future deployments consistent.
- Add an ongoing maintenance plan (content refresh schedule, quarterly SEO review, link rot checks) since the framework is intended for long-term reuse.

## Architecture & Infrastructure
- Provide a high-level architecture diagram/description showing how Astro, Sanity, Netlify, analytics, and third-party embeds interact, including where build hooks and webhooks live.
- Define environments (local, staging/preview, production) and their hosting implications—how content previews work, how deployments are promoted, and whether branch deploys are required for approvals.
- Call out infrastructure as code or configuration management expectations (e.g., Netlify CLI, Terraform) to make redeployments reproducible.
- Plan for dependency isolation: version pinning, upgrade cadence for Astro/Sanity, and how breaking API changes will be tested before rolling out to all podcast sites.

## Template & Theming Strategy
- Expand the theming section with a clear spec for the configuration layer: required tokens, optional overrides, default typography pairings, image ratios, and how custom components can be slotted in per show.
- Define the process for creating a new instance (CLI scaffold, documented checklist, required assets) so the framework truly behaves like a reusable template.
- Document how shared components are versioned and released to downstream podcasts, including a change log and communication plan for breaking changes.

## Content & Data Migration
- Add a URL mapping table or ruleset to ensure every existing strangewater.xyz URL receives a correct 301/302 redirect, and incorporate redirect validation into launch criteria.
- Detail the data validation plan: sample sizes, acceptance criteria for migrated episodes, image optimization checks, and manual QA responsibilities.
- Include fallback behavior for missing or low-quality legacy data (e.g., absent guest photos, incomplete show notes) so migration scripts can gracefully handle edge cases.
- Outline how new podcasts will import legacy content from other hosts/RSS feeds to prove the framework’s reusability beyond Spotify exports.

## SEO & Growth Strategy
- Broaden the SEO plan to include keyword targeting for the new show (topic clusters, schema for blog/editorial content) and specify the tooling for ongoing rank monitoring.
- Define an internal linking strategy between episodes, guests, and any future blog content, with guidance on anchor text and automation through the CMS.
- Incorporate plans for structured data testing in CI/CD and post-launch monitoring (Search Console alerts, crawl budget checks).
- Address off-site growth tactics (backlink outreach, directory submissions, podcast guest swaps) to complement on-site optimization.

## Monetization & Conversion
- Expand on monetization paths beyond Patreon: sponsorship placements, affiliate link management, merch drops, membership tiers—call out when each should be activated.
- Specify where CTAs live in the layout, how they are measured (event tracking, funnel definitions), and provide performance benchmarks.
- Document moderation/approval flows for user-generated inputs (forms, comments) to protect brand integrity.
- Note any requirements for privacy-compliant opt-ins when collecting emails or integrating monetization partners.

## Analytics, Instrumentation & Observability
- Define an analytics stack plan: what events are tracked, naming conventions, dashboards, and how non-technical stakeholders access insights.
- Include error monitoring, uptime alerts, and build failure notifications (e.g., Sentry, Netlify notifications) to ensure ongoing reliability.
- Add retention requirements for logs/metrics and outline a process for data hygiene (PII handling, GDPR/CCPA compliance for EU listeners).
- Consider an experimentation framework (A/B testing cadence, success criteria, guardrail metrics) if optimization is a priority.

## Accessibility, Localization & Compliance
- Elevate accessibility requirements to include concrete acceptance tests: screen-reader compatibility, transcript availability, focus management for embeds, color contrast checks.
- Address localization/internationalization earlier with a strategy for translating static copy, handling right-to-left languages, and structuring content in Sanity to support it.
- Document legal/compliance needs: cookie consent, privacy policy templates, terms of service, age restrictions, and how they adapt per podcast.
- Plan for audio accessibility (captions for trailers/videos, downloadable transcripts) to meet WCAG AA expectations.

## Delivery Plan & QA
- Augment the roadmap with explicit testing activities (unit, integration, visual regression, accessibility audits) and owners for each milestone.
- Describe the deployment pipeline (CI provider, branching model, required approvals) so the project team understands how releases move from development to production.
- Incorporate post-launch monitoring and rollback procedures into the Phase 1 checklist to ensure a smooth cutover from podcastpage.io.
- Add success exit criteria for each phase (e.g., Phase 2 complete when conversion forms have baseline conversion data, transcripts automated for X% of new episodes).

## Risks, Dependencies & Open Questions
- Add risks around vendor lock-in (Sanity pricing changes, Netlify limits) and describe mitigation such as abstraction layers or export scripts.
- Capture dependencies on external APIs (Spotify, Patreon, ConvertKit) and define SLAs, rate limits, and fallback strategies if they fail.
- Expand the open questions to include: long-term content archival strategy, automated backups, security posture (auth for Sanity Studio, secrets management), and governance for community features (comments/moderation).
- Highlight decisions needed for media asset storage (Netlify vs dedicated CDN vs S3) and performance implications for large episode libraries.
