- Rate limiting: Implemented (in-memory for MVP)
- Honeypot: Active spam protection
- Environment variables: No secrets in code

### Performance ✅
- Build time: 20.44s (excellent for 147 pages)
- Query optimization: 80% reduction in API calls (Session 15B fix)
- Build-time caching: Implemented with Promise.all
- Image optimization: Sanity CDN handles it
- Bundle size: Minimal (Astro SSG ships minimal JS)

### Accessibility ✅
- ARIA labels: Present on forms
- Keyboard navigation: Supported
- Form hints: User-friendly guidance
- Error messages: Actionable, not technical
- Semantic HTML: Proper heading hierarchy

### Maintainability ✅
- Constants centralized: src/config/constants.ts
- Error handling: Try-catch with logging
- Type safety: TypeScript strict mode
- JSDoc added: Import scripts documented (Session 15B)
- Test coverage: 40 passing tests

### SEO ✅
- Meta tags: Centralized in BaseLayout
- robots.txt: Proper configuration
- Sitemap: Auto-generated
- Schema.org: Present (podcast markup)
- Core Web Vitals: Expected to be good (static site)

## Positive Findings

**Excellent Code Quality:**
- All security vulnerabilities patched
- Comprehensive input validation
- Proper error handling throughout
- Centralized configuration pattern
- Well-tested critical functions (sanitizeHTML has 13 tests)

**Architecture Strengths:**
- Clean separation of concerns (components, lib, pages)
- CMS-driven theming (no hardcoded values)
- Build-time optimization with caching
- Serverless functions properly isolated

**Best Practices:**
- TypeScript strict mode enforced
- Environment variables standardized
- Constants pattern for configuration
- Security-first approach (XSS prevention, rate limiting)

---

## Recommendations

### No Immediate Actions Required

All code quality issues have been resolved. Codebase is production-ready.

### Next Development Phase

User needs to decide:

1. **Newsletter Implementation** (if approved for Phase 2a)
   - Estimated effort: 12-18 hours
   - Implementation plan ready at `context/tasks/newsletter-plan.md`
   - Security/compliance requirements documented
   - Would add to template value significantly

2. **Tier 1 Features** (alternative to newsletter)
   - Episode transcripts (highest SEO ROI, $25 cost)
   - Episode search (4-6 hours, high UX value)
   - Platform links manual phase (4 hours)

3. **Templatization** (after features complete)
   - Extract remaining hardcoded values
   - Create deployment guide
   - Test with second podcast deployment

### Optional Future Enhancements (Low Priority)

- Increase test coverage beyond sanitizeHTML (currently 40 tests, could expand to other utility functions)
- Add integration tests for Netlify functions (currently only unit tests)
- Consider upgrading from in-memory rate limiting to Redis/persistent solution (only if scaling beyond single instance)
