This will make the "Contribute" link appear in the header and footer.

---

### 3. Get Resend API Key

2. Click **Create API Key**
3. Name it "Podcast Contributions"
4. Copy the API key (starts with `re_`)

---

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file (and Netlify environment variables):

```bash
# Resend Configuration
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
NOTIFICATION_EMAIL=rkirshner@gmail.com
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev  # Use this for testing, or verify your own domain
```

**For production (Netlify):**
1. Go to Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables
2. Add the same three variables above
3. Redeploy your site

---

### 5. Test Locally

1. Ensure Sanity Studio is running (`npm run sanity`)
2. Ensure dev server is running (`npm run dev`)
3. Visit http://localhost:4322/contribute
4. Test submission with each contribution type
5. Check Sanity Studio for new contributions: **Content** ‚Üí **Community Contributions**
6. Check your email for notification

---

### 6. Verify Sanity Schema

The contribution schema should already be visible in Sanity Studio:

1. Open http://localhost:3333/ (Sanity Studio)
2. Look for **"Community Contributions"** in the sidebar
3. You can manually create test contributions here

**Schema Features:**
- 4 contribution types (episode-idea, guest-recommendation, question, feedback)
- Conditional fields (only relevant fields show based on type)
- Status tracking (üÜï New, üëÄ Reviewed, ‚úÖ Actioned, üì¶ Archived)
- Optional submitter name/email (anonymous supported)
- Host notes field (private, not visible to submitter)

---

## Usage

### Accessing the Page

**For Active Podcasts:**
- URL: `/contribute`
- Navigation: Appears in header and footer between "Guests" and "About"

**For Concluded Podcasts:**
- Page returns 404 (feature hidden)
- Navigation links don't appear

### Managing Contributions in Sanity

1. Go to **Content** ‚Üí **Community Contributions**
2. View all submissions with previews
3. Click to open and review details
4. Update status:
   - üÜï **New** - Just received
   - üëÄ **Reviewed** - You've seen it
   - ‚úÖ **Actioned** - You've taken action (invited guest, recorded episode, etc.)
   - üì¶ **Archived** - No longer relevant
5. Add private notes in "Host Notes" field

### Email Notifications

You'll receive an immediate email for each submission with:
- Contribution type and emoji
- Submitter name (or "Anonymous")
- Submitter email (or "No email provided")
- All submission details
- Link to view in Sanity Studio

**Email formatting:**
- HTML formatted for readability
- Color-coded by contribution type
- Includes all relevant fields
- Direct link to Sanity Studio document

---

## Spam Protection

The feature includes two layers of spam protection:

### 1. Honeypot Field
- Hidden form field named "website"
- Bots fill it out, humans don't
- Submissions with honeypot filled are silently accepted (no error shown to bot)

### 2. Rate Limiting
- Maximum 5 submissions per hour per IP address
- After limit, returns 429 error: "Too many submissions. Please try again later."
- Resets after 1 hour
- In-memory store (resets on Netlify cold start, which is fine for MVP)

## Troubleshooting

### "Page not found" when visiting `/contribute`
**Issue:** Podcast not marked as active
**Fix:** Set `isActive = true` in Sanity Studio ‚Üí Podcast Settings

### Email not sending
**Possible causes:**
1. Missing `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable
2. Invalid API key
3. `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` not verified (use `onboarding@resend.dev` for testing)
4. Missing `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` variable

**Check:**
- Netlify function logs for errors
- Resend dashboard for failed sends

### Contribution not appearing in Sanity
**Possible causes:**
1. Missing `SANITY_API_TOKEN` with write permissions
2. Network error
3. Invalid data format

**Fix:**
1. Verify `SANITY_API_TOKEN` is set in Netlify environment variables
2. Check Netlify function logs
3. Test locally first

### Rate limiting too aggressive
**Current limit:** 5 submissions per hour per IP

**To adjust:**
Edit `netlify/functions/contribute.ts`:
```typescript
const RATE_LIMIT = 10; // Change to 10
const RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW = 60 * 60 * 1000; // 1 hour
```
