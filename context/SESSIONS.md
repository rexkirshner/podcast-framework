## Session 2025-10-05A: Context System Initialization

**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Phase:** Pre-Implementation Setup
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### What We Did

**1. Evaluated Claude Context System:**
- Reviewed https://github.com/rexkirshner/claude-context-system
- Assessed fit for 60-day, 120+ task project
- Decision: Install (high complexity, perfect use case)

**2. Installed Context System:**
- Cloned repository, copied `.claude/` and `scripts/` to project
- Created context directory structure:
  - `context/` (documentation)
  - `context/tasks/` (action tracking)
  - `artifacts/` (code reviews, performance reports, etc.)

**3. Configured Project:**
- Updated `.context-config.json` with project metadata
- Set owner: Rex Kirshner
- Set project name: Podcast Website Framework
- Set type: web-app
- Configured workflow preferences (approval required, no push without approval, etc.)

**4. Created Core Documentation:**
- `CLAUDE.md` - Developer guide (tech stack, methodology, commands, preferences)
- `SESSIONS.md` - This file (session history tracking)
- Ready to create task files next

### Decisions Made

**1. Use Minimal Init (Not Full):**
- Rationale: Start with 3 core files (CLAUDE.md, SESSIONS.md, tasks/), grow as needed
- PRD.md already exists at root, no need to duplicate
- ARCHITECTURE.md, DECISIONS.md can be added later if complexity requires

**2. Separate Sanity Project Per Podcast:**
- Each podcast gets own Sanity project (separate project IDs, datasets)
- Benefits: Clean permissions, no cross-contamination, isolated scaling
- Trade-off: Slightly more setup per podcast (acceptable for 4-hour deployment goal)

**3. Scheduled Publishing Strategy:**
- Phase 1 (MVP): Manual publish only (mark as "Scheduled" but manually publish)
- Phase 2: Implement Sanity Scheduled Publishing plugin (automated timed releases)
- Rationale: Keep MVP simple, add automation when proven needed

### Current State

**Project Structure:**
```

├── .claude/                    # Context system commands & docs
├── archive/                    # Pre-project PRD drafts (v1-v6)

```

**Phase:** Pre-Implementation
**Next Milestone:** Day 1 - Project Setup & First Deploy
**Ready to Code:** Yes

### Next Session

**Primary Goal:** Begin Day 1 implementation (Project Setup & First Deploy)

**Morning Tasks (Day 1):**
- [ ] Task 1.1: Create GitHub repository `podcast-framework`
- [ ] Task 1.2: Run `npm create astro@latest`
- [ ] Task 1.3: Install Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Task 1.4-1.6: Environment setup, README, initial commit

**Afternoon Tasks (Day 1):**
- [ ] Task 1.7-1.9: Netlify setup, deployment
- [ ] Task 1.10-1.11: Verify site, configure staging subdomain

**End of Day 1 Goal:** Deployed site accessible at staging URL, auto-deploy working

### Notes

- Multiple `.claude/` directories detected in parent folders (claude admin, inevitable eth, personal website, podcast website)
- Not a blocker for this project, but noted for awareness
- Context system commands may need Claude Code restart to be recognized as slash commands
- For now, manually executing command workflows is working fine

---

## Session 2025-10-05B: Day 1 - Project Setup & First Deploy

**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Phase:** Phase 1a - "Hello World" Deployed Site
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### What We Did

**1. GitHub Repository:**
- Created repository: `podcast-framework`
- Repository URL: https://github.com/rexkirshner/podcast-framework
- Visibility: Public
- Description: "Reusable podcast website framework built with Astro, Sanity CMS, and Netlify. Deploy production-ready podcast sites in <4 hours."

**2. Astro Project Initialization:**
- Initialized Astro project with minimal template
- Configuration: TypeScript strict mode
- Workaround: Created in temp directory due to existing files, then moved to root
- Created files: `astro.config.mjs`, `package.json`, `src/pages/index.astro`, `tsconfig.json`

**3. Tailwind CSS Integration:**
- Installed Tailwind CSS v4 via Astro integration (`npx astro add tailwind`)
- Auto-configured `astro.config.mjs` with Vite plugin
- Created `src/styles/global.css` with Tailwind imports

**4. Project Configuration:**
- Created `.env.example` with placeholders for Sanity config, analytics, monitoring
- Updated `README.md` with comprehensive project documentation
- Git initialization: `git init`, added remote, initial commit

**5. Netlify Deployment:**
- Created Netlify account, connected to GitHub repository
- Auto-detected build settings (correct Astro defaults)
- Deployed successfully to `podcast-framework.netlify.app`
- Site verified loading (default Astro homepage)

**6. Custom Subdomain Configuration:**
- Configured `staging.strangewater.xyz` in Netlify
- Added DNS records in Cloudflare:
  - TXT record: `subdomain-owner-verification` → `87056d3b8f704ebdcb00be056a4b1121`
  - CNAME record: `staging` → `podcast-framework.netlify.app` (DNS only, not proxied)
- DNS propagation in progress (15-30 minutes expected)

### Files Modified/Created

**New files:**
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template
- `.gitignore` - Astro defaults
- `README.md` - Project documentation (125 lines)
- `astro.config.mjs` - Astro + Tailwind configuration
- `package.json` - Dependencies (Astro 5.1.4, Tailwind 4.1.14)
- `src/pages/index.astro` - Default homepage
- `src/styles/global.css` - Tailwind imports
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration

**Git commits:**
- `f9800df` - Initial project setup: Astro + Tailwind + Context System (50 files, 27,005 insertions)

### Decisions Made

**1. Astro Installation Workaround:**
- Problem: `npm create astro@latest .` failed due to non-empty directory
- Solution: Created in `temp-astro/`, moved files to root, cleaned up
- Rationale: Preserves existing context system and documentation files

**2. Cloudflare Proxy Configuration:**
- Decision: Disabled Cloudflare proxy for `staging` subdomain (gray cloud, "DNS only")
- Rationale: Netlify needs direct DNS access for SSL certificate provisioning
- Trade-off: Lose Cloudflare CDN/DDoS protection for staging (acceptable for internal staging site)

```

**Deployment Status:**
- ✅ GitHub repository: https://github.com/rexkirshner/podcast-framework
- ✅ Netlify deployment: https://podcast-framework.netlify.app (live)
- 🚧 Custom subdomain: https://staging.strangewater.xyz (DNS propagating, 15-30 min)

**Phase:** Phase 1a - "Hello World" Deployed Site (Day 1 complete)
**Next Milestone:** Day 2 - First Episode Page (Hardcoded)

### Work In Progress

**None** - All Day 1 tasks complete. Ready for Day 2.

### Next Session

**Primary Goal:** Day 2 - First Episode Page (Hardcoded)

**Morning Tasks (Day 2):**
- [ ] Task 2.1: Create hardcoded episode page layout (`/episodes/1`)
- [ ] Task 2.2: Add basic header component
- [ ] Task 2.3: Add basic footer component
- [ ] Task 2.4: Embed Spotify audio player (iframe)
- [ ] Task 2.5: Style with Tailwind CSS

**Afternoon Tasks (Day 2):**
- [ ] Task 2.6: Test audio playback
- [ ] Task 2.7: Deploy to staging
- [ ] Task 2.8: Verify responsive design
- [ ] Task 2.9: Update homepage to link to episode

**End of Day 2 Goal:** Deployed site with 1 working episode page, playable audio

### Notes

- DNS propagation for `staging.strangewater.xyz` verified via `dig` - CNAME correct, resolves to Netlify IPs
- Netlify will auto-provision SSL certificate once DNS fully propagates globally
- GitHub → Netlify auto-deploy pipeline working (push to `main` triggers production build)
- No branch strategy implemented yet (single `main` branch, will add `develop` for staging in Phase 1b)

## Session 2025-10-05D: Day 4 - Sanity CMS Integration Complete

**Duration:** ~3 hours
**Phase:** Phase 1b - Sanity CMS Integration
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### What We Did

**1. Sanity CMS Setup:**
- Installed Sanity packages manually: `sanity`, `@sanity/client`, `@sanity/vision`, `react`, `react-dom`
- Created three content schemas:
  - `sanity/schemaTypes/podcast.ts` - Podcast metadata (name, description, logo, spotifyShowId, **isActive** toggle)
  - `sanity/schemaTypes/episode.ts` - Episodes (title, slug, episodeNumber, publishDate, duration, description, showNotes, guests, spotifyEpisodeId, coverImage, featured)
  - `sanity/schemaTypes/guest.ts` - Guests (name, bio, photo, social links)
- Created `sanity.config.ts` with project ID `ej6443ov`, dataset `production`
- Created `sanity.cli.ts` for deployment commands
- Sanity Studio running at http://localhost:3333/

**2. Centralized Configuration System:**
- Created `src/config/site.ts` - Single source of truth for all podcast metadata
- Contains: name, tagline, description, spotifyShowId, all social links
- Updated all components (Header, Footer, index, about, episodes) to import from config
- Eliminates scattered hardcoded URLs throughout codebase

**3. Sanity Client Integration:**
- Created `src/lib/sanity.ts` with:
  - TypeScript interfaces: `Podcast`, `Episode`, `Guest`
  - GROQ queries for all content types
  - Helper functions: `getAllEpisodes()`, `getEpisodeBySlug()`, `getFeaturedEpisodes()`, `getPodcastInfo()`, `getAllGuests()`
- All data fetching now happens at build time (SSG)

**4. Updated All Pages to Use Sanity:**
- `src/pages/index.astro` - Fetches latest episode from Sanity
- `src/pages/episodes/index.astro` - Lists all episodes from Sanity
- `src/pages/episodes/[slug].astro` (NEW) - Dynamic episode pages with getStaticPaths
- `src/components/Header.astro` - Displays logo from Sanity podcast info
- All pages show cover images if uploaded, fallback to episode number badge

**5. isActive Toggle System (for concluded shows):**
- Added `isActive` boolean field to podcast schema
- Controls messaging throughout site:
  - If active: "More episodes coming soon..." / "Subscribe to get notified..."
  - If inactive: "This podcast has concluded." / "Explore the complete archive..."
- Updated: episodes list page, individual episode pages
- Perfect for Strange Water (concluded podcast with full archive)

**6. Sample Content Added:**
- Added podcast info in Sanity Studio (Strange Water metadata with logo)
- Added guest: Chris Chauvin
- Added Episode 1: "What is Ethereum and Why Should We Care? w/ Chris Chauvin"

### Files Created/Modified

**New files:**
- `src/config/site.ts` - Centralized configuration
- `src/lib/sanity.ts` - Sanity client with TypeScript types and GROQ queries
- `sanity.config.ts` - Sanity Studio configuration
- `sanity.cli.ts` - Sanity CLI configuration
- `sanity/schemaTypes/podcast.ts` - Podcast schema with isActive toggle
- `sanity/schemaTypes/episode.ts` - Episode schema
- `sanity/schemaTypes/guest.ts` - Guest schema
- `sanity/schemaTypes/index.ts` - Schema exports
- `src/pages/episodes/[slug].astro` - Dynamic episode pages
- `.sanity/` - Sanity runtime files (gitignored)

**Modified files:**
- `src/pages/index.astro` - Fetches latest episode from Sanity, shows cover image
- `src/pages/episodes/index.astro` - Fetches all episodes from Sanity, shows cover images, isActive messaging
- `src/pages/episodes/1.astro` - Updated with centralized config (will be replaced by [slug].astro)
- `src/components/Header.astro` - Fetches and displays logo from Sanity
- `src/components/Footer.astro` - Uses centralized config
- `src/pages/about.astro` - Uses centralized config
- `.env.example` - Updated with Sanity project ID
- `package.json` - Added dependencies: sanity, @sanity/client, @sanity/vision, react, react-dom, styled-components
- `package-lock.json` - Lockfile updates

### Decisions Made

**1. Manual Sanity Setup (not CLI):**
- Problem: `npm create sanity@latest` authentication flow got stuck (browser redirect issue)
- Solution: Manually installed packages and created config files
- Rationale: User already created project via Sanity web UI
- Result: Full control, same outcome, no authentication issues

**2. Centralized Configuration Pattern:**
- Problem: Podcast URLs scattered across Header, Footer, index, about, episodes
- Solution: Created `src/config/site.ts` as single source of truth
- Rationale: User explicitly identified this as a problem ("we aren't storing links in a centralized place")
- Benefits: Easy updates, no URL hunting, clean imports

**3. isActive Toggle for Concluded Shows:**
- Problem: Strange Water is a concluded podcast (won't release new episodes)
- Solution: Added `isActive` boolean to podcast schema
- Rationale: Different messaging for active vs archived shows
- Implementation: Conditional text throughout site based on toggle
- Example: "More episodes coming soon" → "This podcast has concluded"

**4. Cover Images with Fallback:**
- Implementation: Check for `coverImage?.url` first, fallback to number badge
- Rationale: Episodes may or may not have custom cover art
- Result: Graceful degradation, consistent visual hierarchy

### Current State

**Sanity Studio:**
- ✅ Running locally at http://localhost:3333/
- ✅ Three schemas configured (podcast, episode, guest)
- ✅ Sample content added
- 🚧 Not yet deployed to hosted URL (requires hostname selection)

**Astro Site:**
- ✅ All pages fetch from Sanity
- ✅ Dynamic episode routes working
- ✅ Cover images displaying correctly
- ✅ Logo from Sanity showing in header
- ✅ isActive toggle system operational

**Project Structure:**

```

**Dev Servers:**
- Astro: http://localhost:4321/
- Sanity Studio: http://localhost:3333/

**Phase:** Phase 1b - Sanity CMS Integration (Day 4 complete, Days 5-7 remaining)
**Next Milestone:** Deploy Sanity Studio, migrate real episode data

### Work In Progress

**Ready to commit and push:**
- All Sanity integration code complete
- All pages working with Sanity data
- Dev servers running successfully
- Sample content verified

**Next actions:**
1. Deploy Sanity Studio to hosted URL (optional - can use local for now)
2. Commit all changes to git
3. Push to GitHub
4. Delete `src/pages/episodes/1.astro` (replaced by [slug].astro)

### Next Session

**Primary Goal:** Migrate Real Episode Data

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Deploy Sanity Studio to production (optional)
- [ ] Bulk import 69 Strange Water episodes
- [ ] Add all guest information
- [ ] Upload episode cover images
- [ ] Test all episode pages
- [ ] Verify search/filter functionality

**End of Day 5 Goal:** All 69 episodes migrated, site fully powered by Sanity

### Notes

- Sanity authentication via CLI has known issues - manual setup is reliable alternative
- isActive toggle is architecturally important for framework reusability (supports both active and concluded shows)
- Centralized config pattern (`src/config/site.ts`) should be template for all podcast instances
- Dynamic routing with `[slug].astro` + `getStaticPaths()` is core Astro SSG pattern
- Build-time data fetching (not client-side) preserves zero-JS, instant-load benefits
- Sanity project ID: `ej6443ov`, dataset: `production`
- Dev velocity: Completed entire Sanity integration (Day 4 goal) in single session

## Session 2025-10-06E: Day 5 - Complete Data Migration System

**Duration:** ~3 hours
**Phase:** Phase 1b - Sanity CMS Integration (Days 5-7)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### What We Did

**1. RSS Feed Import Script (`scripts/import-from-rss.js`):**
- Automatically fetches episodes from Anchor.fm RSS feed (69 episodes)
- Parses XML using xml2js, extracts all episode metadata
- Generates clean slugs: `sw[episode-number]` (e.g., `/episodes/sw57`)
- Deterministic IDs: `episode-sw${episodeNumber}` for conflict-free re-imports
- Fixed duration parsing to handle HH:MM:SS format from RSS (was returning 0:00)
- Extracts Spotify episode IDs from RSS links (for future use)
- Uses `createOrReplace()` API for idempotent updates (safe to re-run)
- Result: All 69 episodes imported successfully with zero errors

**2. Guest Web Scraper (`scripts/import-guests-from-web.js`):**
- Scrapes guest data from strangewater.xyz/guests (72 guests)
- Extracts: names, Twitter handles, websites, LinkedIn URLs, profile image URLs
- Uses cheerio for HTML parsing
- Generates clean slugs from guest names (removes 0x prefix, special chars)
- Converts Twitter URLs to handles (strips domain for schema compliance)
- Added 200ms delay between requests to be respectful to server
- Fixed duplicate detection using Set to prevent counting same guest twice
- Result: 72 guests imported with all social links

**3. Automated Guest-to-Episode Linking (`scripts/link-guests-to-episodes.js`):**
- Matches guests to episodes by analyzing title + description text
- Smart name variation matching (handles "0xToki", "Toki", case variations)
- Excludes host (LogarithmicRex) from all guest lists automatically
- Special logic for common names (Will Griffiths/Patterson - only match if in title with "w/")
- Detects duplicate references and prevents adding same guest twice
- Flags ambiguous cases for manual review (too many matches, no matches)
- Result: 63 of 67 episodes auto-linked, 4 flagged for manual review

**4. Data Quality Cleanup Scripts:**
- `scripts/check-duplicate-guests.js` - Identified 18 draft guest duplicates
- `scripts/delete-draft-guests.js` - Removed draft documents
- `scripts/fix-draft-references.js` - Updated episode references from drafts to published guests
- `scripts/delete-all-episodes.js` - Clean slate utility for re-imports
- Result: Zero duplicates, clean dataset

**5. Frontend UI Fixes:**
- Added `stripHTML()` helper to remove tags from preview text (episodes list, homepage)
- Fixed logo fallback hierarchy: episode cover → podcast logo → number badge
- Updated Spotify embed to use show-level (episode-specific IDs from Anchor RSS aren't valid)
- Fixed HTML rendering on episode detail pages (use `set:html` directive)
- Added link styling for episode descriptions (blue, underline, hover effects)
- Restarted dev server to clear cached build data (fixed durations, slugs)

**6. PRD Updates:**
- Added Phase 2 feature documentation for episode-specific player & platform links
- Documented current limitation (show-level Spotify embeds)
- Outlined solution paths (Spotify API, URL expansion, manual entry)

### Files Created

**Import Scripts:**
- `scripts/import-from-rss.js` - RSS feed parser & episode importer (274 lines)
- `scripts/import-guests-from-web.js` - Web scraper for guest data (355 lines)
- `scripts/link-guests-to-episodes.js` - Automated guest-episode linking (238 lines)

**Utility Scripts:**
- `scripts/delete-all-episodes.js` - Bulk delete utility (56 lines)
- `scripts/check-duplicate-guests.js` - Duplicate detection (43 lines)
- `scripts/delete-draft-guests.js` - Draft cleanup (44 lines)
- `scripts/fix-draft-references.js` - Reference repair (67 lines)

### Files Modified

- `src/pages/index.astro:45-50` - Added stripHTML helper, logo fallback
- `src/pages/episodes/index.astro:48-85` - Added stripHTML, logo fallback
- `src/pages/episodes/[slug].astro:30-35` - Fixed Spotify embed, HTML rendering
- `package.json:12-14` - Added npm scripts (import:rss, import:guests, link:guests)
- `context/PRD.md:720-733` - Added Phase 2 feature section

**Deleted:**
- `src/pages/episodes/1.astro` - Replaced by dynamic [slug].astro routing

### Decisions Made

**1. RSS Import as Framework Feature:**
- Decision: Build RSS importer as reusable framework tool (not one-off script)
- Rationale: Every podcast migration needs episode import capability
- Implementation: Generic enough to work with any Anchor.fm/Spotify RSS feed
- Future: Could add adapters for Apple Podcasts, Libsyn, Buzzsprout feeds

**2. Deterministic IDs Based on Episode Number:**
- Decision: Use `episode-sw${episodeNumber}` as document ID
- Rationale: Prevents duplicates when re-importing same episodes
- Trade-off: Episode numbers must be stable (can't renumber episodes later)
- Benefit: `createOrReplace()` safely updates existing episodes

**3. sw[number] Slug Format:**
- Decision: Use `sw57` instead of long title-based slugs
- Rationale: Clean, short, memorable URLs
- Example: `/episodes/sw57` vs `/episodes/decentralized-resiliency-the-story-of-badgerdao`
- User suggestion: Rex explicitly requested this format

**4. Show-Level Spotify Embeds (MVP):**
- Decision: Use show embed for all episodes (not episode-specific)
- Rationale: Anchor RSS episode IDs aren't valid Spotify episode IDs
- Trade-off: All episodes show same player (starts at latest episode)
- Phase 2 solution: Implement Spotify API integration or URL expansion

**5. Automated Guest Linking with Manual Review:**
- Decision: Auto-link where confident (63/67), flag ambiguous cases (4)
- Rationale: Faster than 100% manual, safer than 100% automated
- Flagged cases: Missing guests (twMatt, 0xTaiga not in database), trailer/announcement episodes
- User responsibility: Final verification in Sanity Studio

### Current State

**Sanity CMS Data:**
- ✅ 69 episodes fully imported (all metadata, correct durations, clean slugs)
- ✅ 72 guests imported (names, social links, profile image URLs)
- ✅ 63 episodes linked to guests automatically
- 🚧 4 episodes flagged for manual review (2 missing guests, 2 no guests expected)
- 🚧 Profile images not yet uploaded (URLs available in `_profileImageUrl` field)
- 🚧 Guest bios not yet added (scraped job titles in `_jobTitle` field)

**Dev Servers:**
- ✅ Astro: http://localhost:4321/ (all pages working with full dataset)
- ✅ Sanity Studio: http://localhost:3333/ (local, not yet deployed)

**Import Scripts:**
- ✅ `npm run import:rss` - Import/update episodes from RSS
- ✅ `npm run import:guests` - Scrape and import guests
- ✅ `npm run link:guests` - Auto-link guests to episodes
- ✅ `npm run delete:episodes` - Clean slate for re-import

**Phase:** Phase 1b - Sanity CMS Integration (Day 5 complete, Days 6-7 remaining)
**Next Milestone:** Polish & QA (Days 6-7), then Phase 1 launch

### Work In Progress

**Sanity Data (User uploading):**
- User is manually uploading profile photos for all 72 guests via Sanity Studio
- Profile image URLs preserved in `_profileImageUrl` field for reference

**Git Checkpoint:**
- All code changes ready to commit
- Need to push to GitHub to trigger Netlify deployment
- Sanity data will automatically sync to staging (same project ID/dataset)

**Next immediate actions:**
1. Update context/CLAUDE.md with Day 5 completion status
2. Update context/tasks/next-steps.md
3. Update context/meta/claude-context-feedback.md
4. Commit all changes to git
5. Push to GitHub (triggers deploy to staging.strangewater.xyz)

### Next Session

**Primary Goal:** Days 6-7 - Polish, Testing & QA

**Remaining Tasks:**
- [ ] Upload remaining guest profile photos (in progress)
- [ ] Test all 69 episode pages (spot check representative sample)
- [ ] Verify responsive design on mobile/tablet
- [ ] Run Lighthouse audit (target: Performance >90)
- [ ] Test Spotify audio playback across browsers
- [ ] Verify all navigation links work
- [ ] Check SEO meta tags on all pages
- [ ] Test 404 page
- [ ] Verify staging deployment matches local

**End of Days 6-7 Goal:** All episodes live, tested, ready for Phase 1 launch

### Notes

**Key Architectural Wins:**
- Import scripts are reusable across all podcast projects (RSS standard)
- Deterministic IDs prevent duplicate chaos during re-imports
- Guest linking automation saved hours of manual data entry
- Clean separation: scripts/ for data migration, src/ for application code

**Import Script Metrics:**
- RSS import: 69 episodes in ~15 seconds (4.6 episodes/second)
- Guest scraper: 72 guests in ~20 seconds (3.6 guests/second with delay)
- Guest linking: 67 episodes processed in <1 second

**Data Quality Observations:**
- RSS feed durations were in HH:MM:SS format (not seconds as expected)
- Anchor episode IDs from RSS link field aren't valid Spotify IDs
- Draft documents created by Sanity Studio required cleanup
- LogarithmicRex (host) was incorrectly included as guest on all episodes

**User Feedback:**
- User appreciated automated import approach (vs manual entry for 69 episodes)
- User agreed with show-level embeds as MVP compromise
- User explicitly requested sw[number] slug format (excellent suggestion)
- User confirmed automated guest linking was accurate (63/67 auto-linked)
