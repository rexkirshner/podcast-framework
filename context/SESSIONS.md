## Session 2025-10-05A: Context System Initialization

**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Phase:** Pre-Implementation Setup
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### What We Did

**1. Evaluated Claude Context System:**
- Reviewed https://github.com/rexkirshner/claude-context-system
- Assessed fit for 60-day, 120+ task project
- Decision: Install (high complexity, perfect use case)

**2. Installed Context System:**
- Cloned repository, copied `.claude/` and `scripts/` to project
- Created context directory structure:
  - `context/` (documentation)
  - `context/tasks/` (action tracking)
  - `artifacts/` (code reviews, performance reports, etc.)

**3. Configured Project:**
- Updated `.context-config.json` with project metadata
- Set owner: Rex Kirshner
- Set project name: Podcast Website Framework
- Set type: web-app
- Configured workflow preferences (approval required, no push without approval, etc.)

**4. Created Core Documentation:**
- `CLAUDE.md` - Developer guide (tech stack, methodology, commands, preferences)
- `SESSIONS.md` - This file (session history tracking)
- Ready to create task files next

### Decisions Made

**1. Use Minimal Init (Not Full):**
- Rationale: Start with 3 core files (CLAUDE.md, SESSIONS.md, tasks/), grow as needed
- PRD.md already exists at root, no need to duplicate
- ARCHITECTURE.md, DECISIONS.md can be added later if complexity requires

**2. Separate Sanity Project Per Podcast:**
- Each podcast gets own Sanity project (separate project IDs, datasets)
- Benefits: Clean permissions, no cross-contamination, isolated scaling
- Trade-off: Slightly more setup per podcast (acceptable for 4-hour deployment goal)

**3. Scheduled Publishing Strategy:**
- Phase 1 (MVP): Manual publish only (mark as "Scheduled" but manually publish)
- Phase 2: Implement Sanity Scheduled Publishing plugin (automated timed releases)
- Rationale: Keep MVP simple, add automation when proven needed

### Current State

**Project Structure:**
```

```

**Phase:** Pre-Implementation
**Next Milestone:** Day 1 - Project Setup & First Deploy
**Ready to Code:** Yes

### Next Session

**Primary Goal:** Begin Day 1 implementation (Project Setup & First Deploy)

**Morning Tasks (Day 1):**
- [ ] Task 1.1: Create GitHub repository `podcast-framework`
- [ ] Task 1.2: Run `npm create astro@latest`
- [ ] Task 1.3: Install Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Task 1.4-1.6: Environment setup, README, initial commit

**Afternoon Tasks (Day 1):**
- [ ] Task 1.7-1.9: Netlify setup, deployment
- [ ] Task 1.10-1.11: Verify site, configure staging subdomain

**End of Day 1 Goal:** Deployed site accessible at staging URL, auto-deploy working

### Notes

- Multiple `.claude/` directories detected in parent folders (claude admin, inevitable eth, personal website, podcast website)
- Not a blocker for this project, but noted for awareness
- Context system commands may need Claude Code restart to be recognized as slash commands
- For now, manually executing command workflows is working fine

---

## Session 2025-10-05B: Day 1 - Project Setup & First Deploy

**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Phase:** Phase 1a - "Hello World" Deployed Site
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### What We Did

**1. GitHub Repository:**
- Created repository: `podcast-framework`
- Repository URL: https://github.com/rexkirshner/podcast-framework
- Visibility: Public
- Description: "Reusable podcast website framework built with Astro, Sanity CMS, and Netlify. Deploy production-ready podcast sites in <4 hours."

**2. Astro Project Initialization:**
- Initialized Astro project with minimal template
- Configuration: TypeScript strict mode
- Workaround: Created in temp directory due to existing files, then moved to root
- Created files: `astro.config.mjs`, `package.json`, `src/pages/index.astro`, `tsconfig.json`

**3. Tailwind CSS Integration:**
- Installed Tailwind CSS v4 via Astro integration (`npx astro add tailwind`)
- Auto-configured `astro.config.mjs` with Vite plugin
- Created `src/styles/global.css` with Tailwind imports

**4. Project Configuration:**
- Created `.env.example` with placeholders for Sanity config, analytics, monitoring
- Updated `README.md` with comprehensive project documentation
- Git initialization: `git init`, added remote, initial commit

**5. Netlify Deployment:**
- Created Netlify account, connected to GitHub repository
- Auto-detected build settings (correct Astro defaults)
- Deployed successfully to `podcast-framework.netlify.app`
- Site verified loading (default Astro homepage)

**6. Custom Subdomain Configuration:**
- Configured `staging.strangewater.xyz` in Netlify
- Added DNS records in Cloudflare:
  - TXT record: `subdomain-owner-verification` → `87056d3b8f704ebdcb00be056a4b1121`
  - CNAME record: `staging` → `podcast-framework.netlify.app` (DNS only, not proxied)
- DNS propagation in progress (15-30 minutes expected)

### Files Modified/Created

**New files:**
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template
- `.gitignore` - Astro defaults
- `README.md` - Project documentation (125 lines)
- `astro.config.mjs` - Astro + Tailwind configuration
- `package.json` - Dependencies (Astro 5.1.4, Tailwind 4.1.14)
- `src/pages/index.astro` - Default homepage
- `src/styles/global.css` - Tailwind imports
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration

**Git commits:**
- `f9800df` - Initial project setup: Astro + Tailwind + Context System (50 files, 27,005 insertions)

### Decisions Made

**1. Astro Installation Workaround:**
- Problem: `npm create astro@latest .` failed due to non-empty directory
- Solution: Created in `temp-astro/`, moved files to root, cleaned up
- Rationale: Preserves existing context system and documentation files

**2. Cloudflare Proxy Configuration:**
- Decision: Disabled Cloudflare proxy for `staging` subdomain (gray cloud, "DNS only")
- Rationale: Netlify needs direct DNS access for SSL certificate provisioning
- Trade-off: Lose Cloudflare CDN/DDoS protection for staging (acceptable for internal staging site)

```

**Deployment Status:**
- ✅ GitHub repository: https://github.com/rexkirshner/podcast-framework
- ✅ Netlify deployment: https://podcast-framework.netlify.app (live)
- 🚧 Custom subdomain: https://staging.strangewater.xyz (DNS propagating, 15-30 min)

**Phase:** Phase 1a - "Hello World" Deployed Site (Day 1 complete)
**Next Milestone:** Day 2 - First Episode Page (Hardcoded)

### Work In Progress

**None** - All Day 1 tasks complete. Ready for Day 2.

### Next Session

**Primary Goal:** Day 2 - First Episode Page (Hardcoded)

**Morning Tasks (Day 2):**
- [ ] Task 2.1: Create hardcoded episode page layout (`/episodes/1`)
- [ ] Task 2.2: Add basic header component
- [ ] Task 2.3: Add basic footer component
- [ ] Task 2.4: Embed Spotify audio player (iframe)
- [ ] Task 2.5: Style with Tailwind CSS

**Afternoon Tasks (Day 2):**
- [ ] Task 2.6: Test audio playback
- [ ] Task 2.7: Deploy to staging
- [ ] Task 2.8: Verify responsive design
- [ ] Task 2.9: Update homepage to link to episode

**End of Day 2 Goal:** Deployed site with 1 working episode page, playable audio

### Notes

- DNS propagation for `staging.strangewater.xyz` verified via `dig` - CNAME correct, resolves to Netlify IPs
- Netlify will auto-provision SSL certificate once DNS fully propagates globally
- GitHub → Netlify auto-deploy pipeline working (push to `main` triggers production build)
- No branch strategy implemented yet (single `main` branch, will add `develop` for staging in Phase 1b)

## Session 2025-10-05D: Day 4 - Sanity CMS Integration Complete

**Duration:** ~3 hours
**Phase:** Phase 1b - Sanity CMS Integration
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### What We Did

**1. Sanity CMS Setup:**
- Installed Sanity packages manually: `sanity`, `@sanity/client`, `@sanity/vision`, `react`, `react-dom`
- Created three content schemas:
  - `sanity/schemaTypes/podcast.ts` - Podcast metadata (name, description, logo, spotifyShowId, **isActive** toggle)
  - `sanity/schemaTypes/episode.ts` - Episodes (title, slug, episodeNumber, publishDate, duration, description, showNotes, guests, spotifyEpisodeId, coverImage, featured)
  - `sanity/schemaTypes/guest.ts` - Guests (name, bio, photo, social links)
- Created `sanity.config.ts` with project ID `ej6443ov`, dataset `production`
- Created `sanity.cli.ts` for deployment commands
- Sanity Studio running at http://localhost:3333/

**2. Centralized Configuration System:**
- Created `src/config/site.ts` - Single source of truth for all podcast metadata
- Contains: name, tagline, description, spotifyShowId, all social links
- Updated all components (Header, Footer, index, about, episodes) to import from config
- Eliminates scattered hardcoded URLs throughout codebase

**3. Sanity Client Integration:**
- Created `src/lib/sanity.ts` with:
  - TypeScript interfaces: `Podcast`, `Episode`, `Guest`
  - GROQ queries for all content types
  - Helper functions: `getAllEpisodes()`, `getEpisodeBySlug()`, `getFeaturedEpisodes()`, `getPodcastInfo()`, `getAllGuests()`
- All data fetching now happens at build time (SSG)

**4. Updated All Pages to Use Sanity:**
- `src/pages/index.astro` - Fetches latest episode from Sanity
- `src/pages/episodes/index.astro` - Lists all episodes from Sanity
- `src/pages/episodes/[slug].astro` (NEW) - Dynamic episode pages with getStaticPaths
- `src/components/Header.astro` - Displays logo from Sanity podcast info
- All pages show cover images if uploaded, fallback to episode number badge

**5. isActive Toggle System (for concluded shows):**
- Added `isActive` boolean field to podcast schema
- Controls messaging throughout site:
  - If active: "More episodes coming soon..." / "Subscribe to get notified..."
  - If inactive: "This podcast has concluded." / "Explore the complete archive..."
- Updated: episodes list page, individual episode pages
- Perfect for Strange Water (concluded podcast with full archive)

**6. Sample Content Added:**
- Added podcast info in Sanity Studio (Strange Water metadata with logo)
- Added guest: Chris Chauvin
- Added Episode 1: "What is Ethereum and Why Should We Care? w/ Chris Chauvin"

### Files Created/Modified

**New files:**
- `src/config/site.ts` - Centralized configuration
- `src/lib/sanity.ts` - Sanity client with TypeScript types and GROQ queries
- `sanity.config.ts` - Sanity Studio configuration
- `sanity.cli.ts` - Sanity CLI configuration
- `sanity/schemaTypes/podcast.ts` - Podcast schema with isActive toggle
- `sanity/schemaTypes/episode.ts` - Episode schema
- `sanity/schemaTypes/guest.ts` - Guest schema
- `sanity/schemaTypes/index.ts` - Schema exports
- `src/pages/episodes/[slug].astro` - Dynamic episode pages
- `.sanity/` - Sanity runtime files (gitignored)

**Modified files:**
- `src/pages/index.astro` - Fetches latest episode from Sanity, shows cover image
- `src/pages/episodes/index.astro` - Fetches all episodes from Sanity, shows cover images, isActive messaging
- `src/pages/episodes/1.astro` - Updated with centralized config (will be replaced by [slug].astro)
- `src/components/Header.astro` - Fetches and displays logo from Sanity
- `src/components/Footer.astro` - Uses centralized config
- `src/pages/about.astro` - Uses centralized config
- `.env.example` - Updated with Sanity project ID
- `package.json` - Added dependencies: sanity, @sanity/client, @sanity/vision, react, react-dom, styled-components
- `package-lock.json` - Lockfile updates

### Decisions Made

**1. Manual Sanity Setup (not CLI):**
- Problem: `npm create sanity@latest` authentication flow got stuck (browser redirect issue)
- Solution: Manually installed packages and created config files
- Rationale: User already created project via Sanity web UI
- Result: Full control, same outcome, no authentication issues

**2. Centralized Configuration Pattern:**
- Problem: Podcast URLs scattered across Header, Footer, index, about, episodes
- Solution: Created `src/config/site.ts` as single source of truth
- Rationale: User explicitly identified this as a problem ("we aren't storing links in a centralized place")
- Benefits: Easy updates, no URL hunting, clean imports

**3. isActive Toggle for Concluded Shows:**
- Problem: Strange Water is a concluded podcast (won't release new episodes)
- Solution: Added `isActive` boolean to podcast schema
- Rationale: Different messaging for active vs archived shows
- Implementation: Conditional text throughout site based on toggle
- Example: "More episodes coming soon" → "This podcast has concluded"

**4. Cover Images with Fallback:**
- Implementation: Check for `coverImage?.url` first, fallback to number badge
- Rationale: Episodes may or may not have custom cover art
- Result: Graceful degradation, consistent visual hierarchy

### Current State

**Sanity Studio:**
- ✅ Running locally at http://localhost:3333/
- ✅ Three schemas configured (podcast, episode, guest)
- ✅ Sample content added
- 🚧 Not yet deployed to hosted URL (requires hostname selection)

**Astro Site:**
- ✅ All pages fetch from Sanity
- ✅ Dynamic episode routes working
- ✅ Cover images displaying correctly
- ✅ Logo from Sanity showing in header
- ✅ isActive toggle system operational

```

**Dev Servers:**
- Astro: http://localhost:4321/
- Sanity Studio: http://localhost:3333/

**Phase:** Phase 1b - Sanity CMS Integration (Day 4 complete, Days 5-7 remaining)
**Next Milestone:** Deploy Sanity Studio, migrate real episode data

### Work In Progress

**Ready to commit and push:**
- All Sanity integration code complete
- All pages working with Sanity data
- Dev servers running successfully
- Sample content verified

**Next actions:**
1. Deploy Sanity Studio to hosted URL (optional - can use local for now)
2. Commit all changes to git
3. Push to GitHub
4. Delete `src/pages/episodes/1.astro` (replaced by [slug].astro)

### Next Session

**Primary Goal:** Migrate Real Episode Data

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Deploy Sanity Studio to production (optional)
- [ ] Bulk import 69 Strange Water episodes
- [ ] Add all guest information
- [ ] Upload episode cover images
- [ ] Test all episode pages
- [ ] Verify search/filter functionality

**End of Day 5 Goal:** All 69 episodes migrated, site fully powered by Sanity

### Notes

- Sanity authentication via CLI has known issues - manual setup is reliable alternative
- isActive toggle is architecturally important for framework reusability (supports both active and concluded shows)
- Centralized config pattern (`src/config/site.ts`) should be template for all podcast instances
- Dynamic routing with `[slug].astro` + `getStaticPaths()` is core Astro SSG pattern
- Build-time data fetching (not client-side) preserves zero-JS, instant-load benefits
- Sanity project ID: `ej6443ov`, dataset: `production`
- Dev velocity: Completed entire Sanity integration (Day 4 goal) in single session
