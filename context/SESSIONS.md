## Session 2025-10-05A: Context System Initialization

**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Phase:** Pre-Implementation Setup
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

### What We Did

**1. Evaluated Claude Context System:**
- Reviewed https://github.com/rexkirshner/claude-context-system
- Assessed fit for 60-day, 120+ task project
- Decision: Install (high complexity, perfect use case)

**2. Installed Context System:**
- Cloned repository, copied `.claude/` and `scripts/` to project
- Created context directory structure:
  - `context/` (documentation)
  - `context/tasks/` (action tracking)
  - `artifacts/` (code reviews, performance reports, etc.)

**3. Configured Project:**
- Updated `.context-config.json` with project metadata
- Set owner: Rex Kirshner
- Set project name: Podcast Website Framework
- Set type: web-app
- Configured workflow preferences (approval required, no push without approval, etc.)

**4. Created Core Documentation:**
- `CLAUDE.md` - Developer guide (tech stack, methodology, commands, preferences)
- `SESSIONS.md` - This file (session history tracking)
- Ready to create task files next

### Decisions Made

**1. Use Minimal Init (Not Full):**
- Rationale: Start with 3 core files (CLAUDE.md, SESSIONS.md, tasks/), grow as needed
- PRD.md already exists at root, no need to duplicate
- ARCHITECTURE.md, DECISIONS.md can be added later if complexity requires

**2. Separate Sanity Project Per Podcast:**
- Each podcast gets own Sanity project (separate project IDs, datasets)
- Benefits: Clean permissions, no cross-contamination, isolated scaling
- Trade-off: Slightly more setup per podcast (acceptable for 4-hour deployment goal)

**3. Scheduled Publishing Strategy:**
- Phase 1 (MVP): Manual publish only (mark as "Scheduled" but manually publish)
- Phase 2: Implement Sanity Scheduled Publishing plugin (automated timed releases)
- Rationale: Keep MVP simple, add automation when proven needed

### Current State

**Project Structure:**
```
podcast website/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .claude/                    # Context system commands & docs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ archive/                    # Pre-project PRD drafts (v1-v6)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ context/                    # Living documentation (NEW)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .context-config.json   # Project configuration
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md              # Developer guide
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SESSIONS.md            # This file
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks/                 # Action tracking (to be created)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/                    # Validation scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ artifacts/                  # Code reviews, performance reports (NEW)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PRD.md                      # Final PRD (1,239 lines)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md      # Task breakdown (679 lines, 120+ tasks)
```

**Phase:** Pre-Implementation
**Next Milestone:** Day 1 - Project Setup & First Deploy
**Ready to Code:** Yes

### Next Session

**Primary Goal:** Begin Day 1 implementation (Project Setup & First Deploy)

**Morning Tasks (Day 1):**
- [ ] Task 1.1: Create GitHub repository `podcast-framework`
- [ ] Task 1.2: Run `npm create astro@latest`
- [ ] Task 1.3: Install Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Task 1.4-1.6: Environment setup, README, initial commit

**Afternoon Tasks (Day 1):**
- [ ] Task 1.7-1.9: Netlify setup, deployment
- [ ] Task 1.10-1.11: Verify site, configure staging subdomain

**End of Day 1 Goal:** Deployed site accessible at staging URL, auto-deploy working

### Notes

- Multiple `.claude/` directories detected in parent folders (claude admin, inevitable eth, personal website, podcast website)
- Not a blocker for this project, but noted for awareness
- Context system commands may need Claude Code restart to be recognized as slash commands
- For now, manually executing command workflows is working fine
