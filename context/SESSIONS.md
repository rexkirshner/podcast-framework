## Session 2025-10-05A: Context System Initialization

**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Phase:** Pre-Implementation Setup
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### What We Did

**1. Evaluated Claude Context System:**
- Reviewed https://github.com/rexkirshner/claude-context-system
- Assessed fit for 60-day, 120+ task project
- Decision: Install (high complexity, perfect use case)

**2. Installed Context System:**
- Cloned repository, copied `.claude/` and `scripts/` to project
- Created context directory structure:
  - `context/` (documentation)
  - `context/tasks/` (action tracking)
  - `artifacts/` (code reviews, performance reports, etc.)

**3. Configured Project:**
- Updated `.context-config.json` with project metadata
- Set owner: Rex Kirshner
- Set project name: Podcast Website Framework
- Set type: web-app
- Configured workflow preferences (approval required, no push without approval, etc.)

**4. Created Core Documentation:**
- `CLAUDE.md` - Developer guide (tech stack, methodology, commands, preferences)
- `SESSIONS.md` - This file (session history tracking)
- Ready to create task files next

### Decisions Made

**1. Use Minimal Init (Not Full):**
- Rationale: Start with 3 core files (CLAUDE.md, SESSIONS.md, tasks/), grow as needed
- PRD.md already exists at root, no need to duplicate
- ARCHITECTURE.md, DECISIONS.md can be added later if complexity requires

**2. Separate Sanity Project Per Podcast:**
- Each podcast gets own Sanity project (separate project IDs, datasets)
- Benefits: Clean permissions, no cross-contamination, isolated scaling
- Trade-off: Slightly more setup per podcast (acceptable for 4-hour deployment goal)

**3. Scheduled Publishing Strategy:**
- Phase 1 (MVP): Manual publish only (mark as "Scheduled" but manually publish)
- Phase 2: Implement Sanity Scheduled Publishing plugin (automated timed releases)
- Rationale: Keep MVP simple, add automation when proven needed

### Current State

**Project Structure:**
```

├── .claude/                    # Context system commands & docs
├── archive/                    # Pre-project PRD drafts (v1-v6)

```

**Phase:** Pre-Implementation
**Next Milestone:** Day 1 - Project Setup & First Deploy
**Ready to Code:** Yes

### Next Session

**Primary Goal:** Begin Day 1 implementation (Project Setup & First Deploy)

**Morning Tasks (Day 1):**
- [ ] Task 1.1: Create GitHub repository `podcast-framework`
- [ ] Task 1.2: Run `npm create astro@latest`
- [ ] Task 1.3: Install Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Task 1.4-1.6: Environment setup, README, initial commit

**Afternoon Tasks (Day 1):**
- [ ] Task 1.7-1.9: Netlify setup, deployment
- [ ] Task 1.10-1.11: Verify site, configure staging subdomain

**End of Day 1 Goal:** Deployed site accessible at staging URL, auto-deploy working

### Notes

- Multiple `.claude/` directories detected in parent folders (claude admin, inevitable eth, personal website, podcast website)
- Not a blocker for this project, but noted for awareness
- Context system commands may need Claude Code restart to be recognized as slash commands
- For now, manually executing command workflows is working fine

---

## Session 2025-10-05B: Day 1 - Project Setup & First Deploy

**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Phase:** Phase 1a - "Hello World" Deployed Site
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### What We Did

**1. GitHub Repository:**
- Created repository: `podcast-framework`
- Repository URL: https://github.com/rexkirshner/podcast-framework
- Visibility: Public
- Description: "Reusable podcast website framework built with Astro, Sanity CMS, and Netlify. Deploy production-ready podcast sites in <4 hours."

**2. Astro Project Initialization:**
- Initialized Astro project with minimal template
- Configuration: TypeScript strict mode
- Workaround: Created in temp directory due to existing files, then moved to root
- Created files: `astro.config.mjs`, `package.json`, `src/pages/index.astro`, `tsconfig.json`

**3. Tailwind CSS Integration:**
- Installed Tailwind CSS v4 via Astro integration (`npx astro add tailwind`)
- Auto-configured `astro.config.mjs` with Vite plugin
- Created `src/styles/global.css` with Tailwind imports

**4. Project Configuration:**
- Created `.env.example` with placeholders for Sanity config, analytics, monitoring
- Updated `README.md` with comprehensive project documentation
- Git initialization: `git init`, added remote, initial commit

**5. Netlify Deployment:**
- Created Netlify account, connected to GitHub repository
- Auto-detected build settings (correct Astro defaults)
- Deployed successfully to `podcast-framework.netlify.app`
- Site verified loading (default Astro homepage)

**6. Custom Subdomain Configuration:**
- Configured `staging.strangewater.xyz` in Netlify
- Added DNS records in Cloudflare:
  - TXT record: `subdomain-owner-verification` → `87056d3b8f704ebdcb00be056a4b1121`
  - CNAME record: `staging` → `podcast-framework.netlify.app` (DNS only, not proxied)
- DNS propagation in progress (15-30 minutes expected)

### Files Modified/Created

**New files:**
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template
- `.gitignore` - Astro defaults
- `README.md` - Project documentation (125 lines)
- `astro.config.mjs` - Astro + Tailwind configuration
- `package.json` - Dependencies (Astro 5.1.4, Tailwind 4.1.14)
- `src/pages/index.astro` - Default homepage
- `src/styles/global.css` - Tailwind imports
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration

**Git commits:**
- `f9800df` - Initial project setup: Astro + Tailwind + Context System (50 files, 27,005 insertions)

### Decisions Made

**1. Astro Installation Workaround:**
- Problem: `npm create astro@latest .` failed due to non-empty directory
- Solution: Created in `temp-astro/`, moved files to root, cleaned up
- Rationale: Preserves existing context system and documentation files

**2. Cloudflare Proxy Configuration:**
- Decision: Disabled Cloudflare proxy for `staging` subdomain (gray cloud, "DNS only")
- Rationale: Netlify needs direct DNS access for SSL certificate provisioning
- Trade-off: Lose Cloudflare CDN/DDoS protection for staging (acceptable for internal staging site)

```

**Deployment Status:**
- ✅ GitHub repository: https://github.com/rexkirshner/podcast-framework
- ✅ Netlify deployment: https://podcast-framework.netlify.app (live)
- 🚧 Custom subdomain: https://staging.strangewater.xyz (DNS propagating, 15-30 min)

**Phase:** Phase 1a - "Hello World" Deployed Site (Day 1 complete)
**Next Milestone:** Day 2 - First Episode Page (Hardcoded)

### Work In Progress

**None** - All Day 1 tasks complete. Ready for Day 2.

### Next Session

**Primary Goal:** Day 2 - First Episode Page (Hardcoded)

**Morning Tasks (Day 2):**
- [ ] Task 2.1: Create hardcoded episode page layout (`/episodes/1`)
- [ ] Task 2.2: Add basic header component
- [ ] Task 2.3: Add basic footer component
- [ ] Task 2.4: Embed Spotify audio player (iframe)
- [ ] Task 2.5: Style with Tailwind CSS

**Afternoon Tasks (Day 2):**
- [ ] Task 2.6: Test audio playback
- [ ] Task 2.7: Deploy to staging
- [ ] Task 2.8: Verify responsive design
- [ ] Task 2.9: Update homepage to link to episode

**End of Day 2 Goal:** Deployed site with 1 working episode page, playable audio

### Notes

- DNS propagation for `staging.strangewater.xyz` verified via `dig` - CNAME correct, resolves to Netlify IPs
- Netlify will auto-provision SSL certificate once DNS fully propagates globally
- GitHub → Netlify auto-deploy pipeline working (push to `main` triggers production build)
- No branch strategy implemented yet (single `main` branch, will add `develop` for staging in Phase 1b)

## Session 2025-10-05D: Day 4 - Sanity CMS Integration Complete

**Duration:** ~3 hours
**Phase:** Phase 1b - Sanity CMS Integration
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### What We Did

**1. Sanity CMS Setup:**
- Installed Sanity packages manually: `sanity`, `@sanity/client`, `@sanity/vision`, `react`, `react-dom`
- Created three content schemas:
  - `sanity/schemaTypes/podcast.ts` - Podcast metadata (name, description, logo, spotifyShowId, **isActive** toggle)
  - `sanity/schemaTypes/episode.ts` - Episodes (title, slug, episodeNumber, publishDate, duration, description, showNotes, guests, spotifyEpisodeId, coverImage, featured)
  - `sanity/schemaTypes/guest.ts` - Guests (name, bio, photo, social links)
- Created `sanity.config.ts` with project ID `ej6443ov`, dataset `production`
- Created `sanity.cli.ts` for deployment commands
- Sanity Studio running at http://localhost:3333/

**2. Centralized Configuration System:**
- Created `src/config/site.ts` - Single source of truth for all podcast metadata
- Contains: name, tagline, description, spotifyShowId, all social links
- Updated all components (Header, Footer, index, about, episodes) to import from config
- Eliminates scattered hardcoded URLs throughout codebase

**3. Sanity Client Integration:**
- Created `src/lib/sanity.ts` with:
  - TypeScript interfaces: `Podcast`, `Episode`, `Guest`
  - GROQ queries for all content types
  - Helper functions: `getAllEpisodes()`, `getEpisodeBySlug()`, `getFeaturedEpisodes()`, `getPodcastInfo()`, `getAllGuests()`
- All data fetching now happens at build time (SSG)

**4. Updated All Pages to Use Sanity:**
- `src/pages/index.astro` - Fetches latest episode from Sanity
- `src/pages/episodes/index.astro` - Lists all episodes from Sanity
- `src/pages/episodes/[slug].astro` (NEW) - Dynamic episode pages with getStaticPaths
- `src/components/Header.astro` - Displays logo from Sanity podcast info
- All pages show cover images if uploaded, fallback to episode number badge

**5. isActive Toggle System (for concluded shows):**
- Added `isActive` boolean field to podcast schema
- Controls messaging throughout site:
  - If active: "More episodes coming soon..." / "Subscribe to get notified..."
  - If inactive: "This podcast has concluded." / "Explore the complete archive..."
- Updated: episodes list page, individual episode pages
- Perfect for Strange Water (concluded podcast with full archive)

**6. Sample Content Added:**
- Added podcast info in Sanity Studio (Strange Water metadata with logo)
- Added guest: Chris Chauvin
- Added Episode 1: "What is Ethereum and Why Should We Care? w/ Chris Chauvin"

### Files Created/Modified

**New files:**
- `src/config/site.ts` - Centralized configuration
- `src/lib/sanity.ts` - Sanity client with TypeScript types and GROQ queries
- `sanity.config.ts` - Sanity Studio configuration
- `sanity.cli.ts` - Sanity CLI configuration
- `sanity/schemaTypes/podcast.ts` - Podcast schema with isActive toggle
- `sanity/schemaTypes/episode.ts` - Episode schema
- `sanity/schemaTypes/guest.ts` - Guest schema
- `sanity/schemaTypes/index.ts` - Schema exports
- `src/pages/episodes/[slug].astro` - Dynamic episode pages
- `.sanity/` - Sanity runtime files (gitignored)

**Modified files:**
- `src/pages/index.astro` - Fetches latest episode from Sanity, shows cover image
- `src/pages/episodes/index.astro` - Fetches all episodes from Sanity, shows cover images, isActive messaging
- `src/pages/episodes/1.astro` - Updated with centralized config (will be replaced by [slug].astro)
- `src/components/Header.astro` - Fetches and displays logo from Sanity
- `src/components/Footer.astro` - Uses centralized config
- `src/pages/about.astro` - Uses centralized config
- `.env.example` - Updated with Sanity project ID
- `package.json` - Added dependencies: sanity, @sanity/client, @sanity/vision, react, react-dom, styled-components
- `package-lock.json` - Lockfile updates

### Decisions Made

**1. Manual Sanity Setup (not CLI):**
- Problem: `npm create sanity@latest` authentication flow got stuck (browser redirect issue)
- Solution: Manually installed packages and created config files
- Rationale: User already created project via Sanity web UI
- Result: Full control, same outcome, no authentication issues

**2. Centralized Configuration Pattern:**
- Problem: Podcast URLs scattered across Header, Footer, index, about, episodes
- Solution: Created `src/config/site.ts` as single source of truth
- Rationale: User explicitly identified this as a problem ("we aren't storing links in a centralized place")
- Benefits: Easy updates, no URL hunting, clean imports

**3. isActive Toggle for Concluded Shows:**
- Problem: Strange Water is a concluded podcast (won't release new episodes)
- Solution: Added `isActive` boolean to podcast schema
- Rationale: Different messaging for active vs archived shows
- Implementation: Conditional text throughout site based on toggle
- Example: "More episodes coming soon" → "This podcast has concluded"

**4. Cover Images with Fallback:**
- Implementation: Check for `coverImage?.url` first, fallback to number badge
- Rationale: Episodes may or may not have custom cover art
- Result: Graceful degradation, consistent visual hierarchy

### Current State

**Sanity Studio:**
- ✅ Running locally at http://localhost:3333/
- ✅ Three schemas configured (podcast, episode, guest)
- ✅ Sample content added
- 🚧 Not yet deployed to hosted URL (requires hostname selection)

**Astro Site:**
- ✅ All pages fetch from Sanity
- ✅ Dynamic episode routes working
- ✅ Cover images displaying correctly
- ✅ Logo from Sanity showing in header
- ✅ isActive toggle system operational

**Project Structure:**

```

**Dev Servers:**
- Astro: http://localhost:4321/
- Sanity Studio: http://localhost:3333/

**Phase:** Phase 1b - Sanity CMS Integration (Day 4 complete, Days 5-7 remaining)
**Next Milestone:** Deploy Sanity Studio, migrate real episode data

### Work In Progress

**Ready to commit and push:**
- All Sanity integration code complete
- All pages working with Sanity data
- Dev servers running successfully
- Sample content verified

**Next actions:**
1. Deploy Sanity Studio to hosted URL (optional - can use local for now)
2. Commit all changes to git
3. Push to GitHub
4. Delete `src/pages/episodes/1.astro` (replaced by [slug].astro)

### Next Session

**Primary Goal:** Migrate Real Episode Data

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Deploy Sanity Studio to production (optional)
- [ ] Bulk import 69 Strange Water episodes
- [ ] Add all guest information
- [ ] Upload episode cover images
- [ ] Test all episode pages
- [ ] Verify search/filter functionality

**End of Day 5 Goal:** All 69 episodes migrated, site fully powered by Sanity

### Notes

- Sanity authentication via CLI has known issues - manual setup is reliable alternative
- isActive toggle is architecturally important for framework reusability (supports both active and concluded shows)
- Centralized config pattern (`src/config/site.ts`) should be template for all podcast instances
- Dynamic routing with `[slug].astro` + `getStaticPaths()` is core Astro SSG pattern
- Build-time data fetching (not client-side) preserves zero-JS, instant-load benefits
- Sanity project ID: `ej6443ov`, dataset: `production`
- Dev velocity: Completed entire Sanity integration (Day 4 goal) in single session

## Session 2025-10-06E: Day 5 - Complete Data Migration System

**Duration:** ~3 hours
**Phase:** Phase 1b - Sanity CMS Integration (Days 5-7)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### What We Did

**1. RSS Feed Import Script (`scripts/import-from-rss.js`):**
- Automatically fetches episodes from Anchor.fm RSS feed (69 episodes)
- Parses XML using xml2js, extracts all episode metadata
- Generates clean slugs: `sw[episode-number]` (e.g., `/episodes/sw57`)
- Deterministic IDs: `episode-sw${episodeNumber}` for conflict-free re-imports
- Fixed duration parsing to handle HH:MM:SS format from RSS (was returning 0:00)
- Extracts Spotify episode IDs from RSS links (for future use)
- Uses `createOrReplace()` API for idempotent updates (safe to re-run)
- Result: All 69 episodes imported successfully with zero errors

**2. Guest Web Scraper (`scripts/import-guests-from-web.js`):**
- Scrapes guest data from strangewater.xyz/guests (72 guests)
- Extracts: names, Twitter handles, websites, LinkedIn URLs, profile image URLs
- Uses cheerio for HTML parsing
- Generates clean slugs from guest names (removes 0x prefix, special chars)
- Converts Twitter URLs to handles (strips domain for schema compliance)
- Added 200ms delay between requests to be respectful to server
- Fixed duplicate detection using Set to prevent counting same guest twice
- Result: 72 guests imported with all social links

**3. Automated Guest-to-Episode Linking (`scripts/link-guests-to-episodes.js`):**
- Matches guests to episodes by analyzing title + description text
- Smart name variation matching (handles "0xToki", "Toki", case variations)
- Excludes host (LogarithmicRex) from all guest lists automatically
- Special logic for common names (Will Griffiths/Patterson - only match if in title with "w/")
- Detects duplicate references and prevents adding same guest twice
- Flags ambiguous cases for manual review (too many matches, no matches)
- Result: 63 of 67 episodes auto-linked, 4 flagged for manual review

**4. Data Quality Cleanup Scripts:**
- `scripts/check-duplicate-guests.js` - Identified 18 draft guest duplicates
- `scripts/delete-draft-guests.js` - Removed draft documents
- `scripts/fix-draft-references.js` - Updated episode references from drafts to published guests
- `scripts/delete-all-episodes.js` - Clean slate utility for re-imports
- Result: Zero duplicates, clean dataset

**5. Frontend UI Fixes:**
- Added `stripHTML()` helper to remove tags from preview text (episodes list, homepage)
- Fixed logo fallback hierarchy: episode cover → podcast logo → number badge
- Updated Spotify embed to use show-level (episode-specific IDs from Anchor RSS aren't valid)
- Fixed HTML rendering on episode detail pages (use `set:html` directive)
- Added link styling for episode descriptions (blue, underline, hover effects)
- Restarted dev server to clear cached build data (fixed durations, slugs)

**6. PRD Updates:**
- Added Phase 2 feature documentation for episode-specific player & platform links
- Documented current limitation (show-level Spotify embeds)
- Outlined solution paths (Spotify API, URL expansion, manual entry)

### Files Created

**Import Scripts:**
- `scripts/import-from-rss.js` - RSS feed parser & episode importer (274 lines)
- `scripts/import-guests-from-web.js` - Web scraper for guest data (355 lines)
- `scripts/link-guests-to-episodes.js` - Automated guest-episode linking (238 lines)

**Utility Scripts:**
- `scripts/delete-all-episodes.js` - Bulk delete utility (56 lines)
- `scripts/check-duplicate-guests.js` - Duplicate detection (43 lines)
- `scripts/delete-draft-guests.js` - Draft cleanup (44 lines)
- `scripts/fix-draft-references.js` - Reference repair (67 lines)

### Files Modified

- `src/pages/index.astro:45-50` - Added stripHTML helper, logo fallback
- `src/pages/episodes/index.astro:48-85` - Added stripHTML, logo fallback
- `src/pages/episodes/[slug].astro:30-35` - Fixed Spotify embed, HTML rendering
- `package.json:12-14` - Added npm scripts (import:rss, import:guests, link:guests)
- `context/PRD.md:720-733` - Added Phase 2 feature section

**Deleted:**
- `src/pages/episodes/1.astro` - Replaced by dynamic [slug].astro routing

### Decisions Made

**1. RSS Import as Framework Feature:**
- Decision: Build RSS importer as reusable framework tool (not one-off script)
- Rationale: Every podcast migration needs episode import capability
- Implementation: Generic enough to work with any Anchor.fm/Spotify RSS feed
- Future: Could add adapters for Apple Podcasts, Libsyn, Buzzsprout feeds

**2. Deterministic IDs Based on Episode Number:**
- Decision: Use `episode-sw${episodeNumber}` as document ID
- Rationale: Prevents duplicates when re-importing same episodes
- Trade-off: Episode numbers must be stable (can't renumber episodes later)
- Benefit: `createOrReplace()` safely updates existing episodes

**3. sw[number] Slug Format:**
- Decision: Use `sw57` instead of long title-based slugs
- Rationale: Clean, short, memorable URLs
- Example: `/episodes/sw57` vs `/episodes/decentralized-resiliency-the-story-of-badgerdao`
- User suggestion: Rex explicitly requested this format

**4. Show-Level Spotify Embeds (MVP):**
- Decision: Use show embed for all episodes (not episode-specific)
- Rationale: Anchor RSS episode IDs aren't valid Spotify episode IDs
- Trade-off: All episodes show same player (starts at latest episode)
- Phase 2 solution: Implement Spotify API integration or URL expansion

**5. Automated Guest Linking with Manual Review:**
- Decision: Auto-link where confident (63/67), flag ambiguous cases (4)
- Rationale: Faster than 100% manual, safer than 100% automated
- Flagged cases: Missing guests (twMatt, 0xTaiga not in database), trailer/announcement episodes
- User responsibility: Final verification in Sanity Studio

### Current State

**Sanity CMS Data:**
- ✅ 69 episodes fully imported (all metadata, correct durations, clean slugs)
- ✅ 72 guests imported (names, social links, profile image URLs)
- ✅ 63 episodes linked to guests automatically
- 🚧 4 episodes flagged for manual review (2 missing guests, 2 no guests expected)
- 🚧 Profile images not yet uploaded (URLs available in `_profileImageUrl` field)
- 🚧 Guest bios not yet added (scraped job titles in `_jobTitle` field)

**Dev Servers:**
- ✅ Astro: http://localhost:4321/ (all pages working with full dataset)
- ✅ Sanity Studio: http://localhost:3333/ (local, not yet deployed)

**Import Scripts:**
- ✅ `npm run import:rss` - Import/update episodes from RSS
- ✅ `npm run import:guests` - Scrape and import guests
- ✅ `npm run link:guests` - Auto-link guests to episodes
- ✅ `npm run delete:episodes` - Clean slate for re-import

**Phase:** Phase 1b - Sanity CMS Integration (Day 5 complete, Days 6-7 remaining)
**Next Milestone:** Polish & QA (Days 6-7), then Phase 1 launch

### Work In Progress

**Sanity Data (User uploading):**
- User is manually uploading profile photos for all 72 guests via Sanity Studio
- Profile image URLs preserved in `_profileImageUrl` field for reference

**Git Checkpoint:**
- All code changes ready to commit
- Need to push to GitHub to trigger Netlify deployment
- Sanity data will automatically sync to staging (same project ID/dataset)

**Next immediate actions:**
1. Update context/CLAUDE.md with Day 5 completion status
2. Update context/tasks/next-steps.md
3. Update context/meta/claude-context-feedback.md
4. Commit all changes to git
5. Push to GitHub (triggers deploy to staging.strangewater.xyz)

### Next Session

**Primary Goal:** Days 6-7 - Polish, Testing & QA

**Remaining Tasks:**
- [ ] Upload remaining guest profile photos (in progress)
- [ ] Test all 69 episode pages (spot check representative sample)
- [ ] Verify responsive design on mobile/tablet
- [ ] Run Lighthouse audit (target: Performance >90)
- [ ] Test Spotify audio playback across browsers
- [ ] Verify all navigation links work
- [ ] Check SEO meta tags on all pages
- [ ] Test 404 page
- [ ] Verify staging deployment matches local

**End of Days 6-7 Goal:** All episodes live, tested, ready for Phase 1 launch

### Notes

**Key Architectural Wins:**
- Import scripts are reusable across all podcast projects (RSS standard)
- Deterministic IDs prevent duplicate chaos during re-imports
- Guest linking automation saved hours of manual data entry
- Clean separation: scripts/ for data migration, src/ for application code

**Import Script Metrics:**
- RSS import: 69 episodes in ~15 seconds (4.6 episodes/second)
- Guest scraper: 72 guests in ~20 seconds (3.6 guests/second with delay)
- Guest linking: 67 episodes processed in <1 second

**Data Quality Observations:**
- RSS feed durations were in HH:MM:SS format (not seconds as expected)
- Anchor episode IDs from RSS link field aren't valid Spotify IDs
- Draft documents created by Sanity Studio required cleanup
- LogarithmicRex (host) was incorrectly included as guest on all episodes

**User Feedback:**
- User appreciated automated import approach (vs manual entry for 69 episodes)
- User agreed with show-level embeds as MVP compromise
- User explicitly requested sw[number] slug format (excellent suggestion)
- User confirmed automated guest linking was accurate (63/67 auto-linked)

## Session 2025-10-06F: Code Review Fixes & Photo Upload Complete

**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Phase:** Phase 1b - Polish & QA (Days 6-7)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### What We Did

**1. Code Review & Fixes (Option A - Critical Issues):**
- Completed comprehensive code review (22 issues found, Grade B 82/100)
- Created improvement plan with 3 options (chose Option A: fix critical issues first)
- Fixed 5 critical code quality issues:
  - **M4** - Renamed package from "temp-astro" to "podcast-framework" (`package.json:2`)
  - **C1** - Moved Sanity project ID to environment variables (9 files total):
    - `.env.example` - Added PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID and SANITY_PROJECT_ID
    - `.env` - Added both variants for Astro and Node.js
    - `src/lib/sanity.ts:8` - Uses `import.meta.env.PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` with validation
    - All 8 scripts - Use `process.env.SANITY_PROJECT_ID` with validation
  - **H2** - Extracted duplicate helpers to `src/lib/utils.ts`:
    - Created `formatDate()` - Date formatter used across all pages
    - Created `stripHTML()` - HTML tag stripper with entity decoding
    - Updated 3 pages to import from utils instead of defining inline
  - **M1** - Added confirmation prompt to delete script (`scripts/delete-all-episodes.js:47-64`)
  - **H4** - Implemented functional mobile menu (`src/components/Header.astro:47-145`)

**2. Content/Data Fixes:**
- **Fixed HTML entities**: Updated `stripHTML()` to decode `&#39;` → `'`, `&amp;` → `&`, etc.
- **Fixed missing `_key` in guests arrays**: Created `scripts/fix-guests-keys.js`, fixed 13 episodes (54 already had keys)
- **Fixed trailer numbering**: Updated `scripts/import-from-rss.js:44-67` to detect "Trailer" in titles and assign episode 0, re-imported all 69 episodes (trailer now episode 0, "What is Ethereum..." restored as episode 1)

**3. Guest Photo Upload:**
- Created `scripts/upload-guest-photos.js` - Automated photo upload script
- Matched 71 photo files to guest records by filename
- Uploaded 65 guest photos successfully to Sanity (6 skipped due to name mismatches)
- Photos now display on episode pages and guest lists

**4. Cleanup:**
- Audited and killed 11 duplicate background processes (11 stale dev/sanity servers)
- Cleaned up to 2 active background tasks (dev + sanity)

### Files Created

**New Scripts:**
- `scripts/fix-guests-keys.js` - Adds `_key` to guest arrays (Sanity requirement)
- `scripts/upload-guest-photos.js` - Bulk upload guest photos from local directory
- `scripts/setup-webhook.js` - Sanity→Netlify webhook setup (deferred to Phase 1c)

**New Utilities:**
- `src/lib/utils.ts` - Shared helper functions (`formatDate`, `stripHTML`)

**New Documentation:**
- `artifacts/code-reviews/session-1-review.md` - Complete code review (22 issues)
- `artifacts/code-reviews/improvement-plan.md` - 3 improvement options

### Files Modified

**Environment & Config:**
- `.env.example:2-6` - Added PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID and SANITY_PROJECT_ID
- `.env:2-6` - Added both PUBLIC_ and non-PUBLIC_ variants
- `package.json:2` - Renamed to "podcast-framework"
- `package.json:17` - Added `upload:photos` and `fix:guests-keys` scripts

**Frontend:**
- `src/lib/sanity.ts:8-19` - Uses env vars with validation
- `src/pages/index.astro:3-12` - Imports from utils, removed duplicate helpers
- `src/pages/episodes/index.astro:3-11` - Imports from utils
- `src/pages/episodes/[slug].astro:3-9` - Imports formatDate from utils
- `src/components/Header.astro:47-145` - Added functional mobile menu with toggle

**Scripts:**
- `scripts/import-from-rss.js:44-67` - Detects trailer, assigns episode 0
- `scripts/delete-all-episodes.js:47-64` - Added confirmation prompt
- All 8 scripts - Moved to `process.env.SANITY_PROJECT_ID`

**Context:**
- `context/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md:524-531` - Added webhook task to Day 7
- `context/tasks/todo.md` - Tracked code review fixes

### Decisions Made

**1. Fix Critical Issues First (Option A):**
- Chose Option A over B (all 22 issues) or C (defer all)
- Rationale: Address security (hardcoded IDs), code quality (duplicates), UX (mobile menu) now
- Implementation: 4-5 hour investment, addressed 5 most impactful issues
- Result: Code quality improved from B (82%) to estimated A- (90%)

**2. Defer Webhook Setup:**
- Decision: Manual webhook setup in Sanity dashboard (not automated script)
- Rationale: API token lacks webhook permissions, manual setup takes <2 minutes
- Moved to: Task 7.9 in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (Day 7 - Phase 1c)

**3. HTML Entity Decoding in stripHTML:**
- Decision: Decode common entities (&#39;, &amp;, etc.) in `stripHTML()` helper
- Rationale: Episode descriptions contain encoded apostrophes from RSS feed
- Implementation: Added `decodeHTMLEntities()` helper function
- Result: `/episodes` page now shows clean text: "today's" not "today&#39;s"

**4. Automated Photo Upload:**
- Decision: Match photos to guests by filename parsing
- Rationale: 71 photos to upload manually would take hours
- Implementation: Parse "episode-guest-name.png" → match to guest by normalized name
- Result: 65/71 photos uploaded successfully (6 name mismatches for manual upload)

### Current State

**Code Quality:**
- ✅ Package properly named
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets (all env vars)
- ✅ No code duplication (utils.ts)
- ✅ Mobile menu functional
- ✅ Delete script has confirmation
- 🚧 16 remaining issues from code review (can address in Phase 2)

**Content:**
- ✅ All 69 episodes imported with correct numbers (0-69, trailer is 0)
- ✅ HTML entities decoded properly
- ✅ All guest arrays have `_key` (Sanity Studio editing works)
- ✅ 65 guest photos uploaded
- 🚧 6 guest photos need manual upload (name mismatches)

**Dev Servers:**
- ✅ Astro: http://localhost:4322/ (switched port due to conflict)
- ✅ Sanity Studio: http://localhost:3333/

**Phase:** Phase 1b - Sanity CMS Integration (Days 6-7 - Ready for launch)
**Next Milestone:** Final QA & Deploy to Production

### Work In Progress

**Ready for commit:**
- All code quality fixes complete
- All content fixes complete
- Guest photos uploaded (except 6 manual ones)

**Next actions:**
1. Update CLAUDE.md current status
2. Commit changes to git with descriptive message
3. Push to GitHub (triggers Netlify deploy)
4. Take break as user requested

### Next Session

**Primary Goal:** Final QA & Production Launch

**Remaining Tasks:**
- [ ] Upload 6 remaining guest photos manually (name mismatches: 0xTaiga, Sydney Huang, Alan, Scott Dykstra, Omni Network, Aiham)
- [ ] Run Lighthouse audit (target: Performance >90)
- [ ] Test sample of 69 episode pages
- [ ] Verify responsive design on mobile
- [ ] Check all navigation links
- [ ] Manual Sanity webhook setup (Task 7.9)
- [ ] Deploy to production domain

**End of Phase 1b Goal:** Production site live, all 69 episodes accessible

### Notes

**Code Review Insights:**
- Most issues were low-severity (L: 5, M: 7, H: 8, C: 2)
- Critical issues (C1, C2) were security-related (hardcoded IDs)
- High-severity issues (H2, H4) were code quality & UX
- Framework will benefit from fixing these issues before reuse

**Import/Migration Metrics:**
- Code review: 22 issues found in ~30 minutes
- Fixes completed: 5 issues in ~2 hours
- Guest photos uploaded: 65 photos in ~2 minutes (automated)
- HTML entity decoding: Fixed 100% of episodes with encoded text

**User Workflow:**
- User spent session editing content in Sanity Studio
- Background automation (photo upload) ran while user worked
- Parallel workflows maximized productivity

**Technical Wins:**
- Environment variable pattern now framework-ready
- Shared utilities prevent future code duplication
- Automated photo upload saved hours of manual work
- Mobile menu provides full navigation on all devices

## Session 9 - 2025-10-06: Host/Guest Separation, Episode Covers & UI Polish

**Focus:** Implemented host schema, uploaded episode artwork, polished episode page UI

**Accomplishments:**

1. **Platform Links (Context Loss Recovery)**
   - Resumed from previous context loss regarding platform link imports
   - Verified 68/69 episodes have platform links (Episode 61 was missing, user added manually)
   - Fixed episode-specific Spotify embeds by extracting episode IDs from `spotifyLink`

2. **Host/Guest Separation**
   - Created `sanity/schemaTypes/host.ts` - New content type (separate from guests)
   - Added `hosts` field to episode schema before guests field
   - Created Host TypeScript interface in `src/lib/sanity.ts:37-53`
   - Updated all GROQ queries to fetch hosts alongside guests
   - Created Rex Kirshner as host (`scripts/create-rex-host.js`)
   - Added Rex to all 68 episodes (`scripts/add-rex-to-all-episodes.js`)

3. **Episode Page UI Refinements**
   - `src/pages/episodes/[slug].astro:72-148` - Hosts/guests layout restructured
   - Changed from `flex-1` (full width) to auto-width containers (no excessive spacing)
   - Made layout side-by-side: `flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-6`
   - Dynamic labels: "Host"/"Hosts" and "Guest"/"Guests" based on count
   - Moved "About This Episode" section above audio player
   - Removed blue background from platform links section

4. **Episode Artwork Automation**
   - Discovered Anchor.fm RSS feed no longer accessible (404 error)
   - Created `context/AUTOMATION_NOTES.md` - Technical research document
   - Documented 3 automation approaches for Phase 2:
     - Spotify Web API (recommended, 4-6 hours)
     - Apple Podcasts RSS (fallback, 2-4 hours)
     - Webhook system (ideal, 8-12 hours)
   - Updated `context/tasks/next-steps.md` with Phase 2 automation requirements
   - Manual upload acceptable for Strange Water (completed podcast)

5. **Episode Cover Upload**
   - Created `scripts/upload-episode-covers.js` - Automated artwork upload
   - Uploaded 66/68 episode covers from `~/Desktop/vibe-coding-assets/strange water/episode covers/`
   - Added `npm run upload:covers` command to `package.json:18`
   - Missing covers: Episode 0 (trailer) and Episode 40 (no file found)

**Files Modified/Created:**

Core Implementation:
- `sanity/schemaTypes/host.ts` - New host content type (created)
- `sanity/schemaTypes/index.ts:5` - Registered host schema
- `sanity/schemaTypes/episode.ts:85-89` - Added hosts field
- `src/lib/sanity.ts:37-53` - Host interface and updated queries
- `src/pages/episodes/[slug].astro:27-35,72-148,150-216` - Episode-specific embeds, hosts/guests UI, description repositioning
- `scripts/create-rex-host.js` - Host creation automation (created)
- `scripts/add-rex-to-all-episodes.js` - Bulk host assignment (created)
- `scripts/upload-episode-covers.js` - Automated cover upload (created)
- `scripts/check-episode-guests.js` - Diagnostic utility (created)
- `package.json:18` - Added upload:covers command

Documentation:
- `context/AUTOMATION_NOTES.md` - Episode artwork automation research (created)
- `context/tasks/next-steps.md:146-194` - Future automation requirements section

**Current State:**

Sanity Data:
- 68 episodes with hosts (Rex Kirshner added to all)
- 72 guests linked to 63 episodes
- 66 episode covers uploaded (missing: 0, 40)
- Platform links: 68/69 episodes (Episode 61 added manually)

Episode Page:
- Episode-specific Spotify embeds working correctly
- Hosts displayed before guests (side-by-side on desktop)
- "About This Episode" appears above audio player
- Dynamic labels based on count (Host/Hosts, Guest/Guests)
- Platform links without blue background

**Next Steps:**

Immediate (Days 6-7 - Polish & QA):
1. Test sample of episode pages (verify all work correctly)
2. Verify responsive design on mobile/tablet
3. Run Lighthouse audit (target: Performance >90)
4. Test Spotify audio playback across browsers
5. Verify all navigation links
6. Check SEO meta tags on all page types

Future (Phase 2 - Automation):
1. Research Spotify Web API for episode metadata
2. Implement automated artwork import for active podcasts
3. Build multi-platform support (Spotify, Apple, YouTube)

**Technical Decisions:**

1. **Host as Separate Content Type**
   - Rationale: Clean separation of concerns, scalable for multi-host podcasts
   - Alternative considered: Reuse guest type with role field (rejected - less clear)
   - Trade-off: More schemas to manage, but better data model

2. **Manual Artwork Upload for Strange Water**
   - Rationale: One-time task, podcast is complete, automation not worth immediate investment
   - Future: MUST automate for active podcasts (Phase 2 requirement)
   - Documented solutions in AUTOMATION_NOTES.md for future implementation

3. **Episode-Specific Spotify Embeds**
   - Rationale: Extract episode ID from spotifyLink using regex
   - Fallback: Show-level embed if no episode link exists
   - Pattern: `https://open.spotify.com/episode/[ID]` → `/embed/episode/[ID]`

**Commits This Session:**
- `cf2acef` - Fix episode numbering and import platform links
- `4dad569` - Add platform link UI to episode pages
- `c291d7c` - Use episode-specific Spotify embeds
- `8f2b33a` - Add host support and Rex as host to all episodes
- `ea272ae` - Make hosts/guests side by side
- `f2f5e35` - Document episode artwork automation for Phase 2
- `89a90ec` - Add episode cover upload and UI improvements

**Notes:**
- Artwork automation is now fully documented for Phase 2 (AUTOMATION_NOTES.md)
- Strange Water has all metadata except 2 episode covers (acceptable for launch)
- Framework now supports both hosts and guests (ready for multi-host podcasts)
- All changes pushed to GitHub (7 commits)

## Session 10 - 2025-10-06H: Google Analytics 4 & BaseLayout Refactor - Phase 1 Complete

**Duration:** ~1.5 hours
**Phase:** Phase 1b - Polish & QA (Day 6)
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Phase 1 Finished!

### What We Did

**1. Google Analytics 4 Integration:**
- Added GA4 tracking script to `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro:22,54-60`
- Configured environment variable: `PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-V74NXPXZWQ` (`.env:9`)
- Used Astro-specific script directives (`is:inline`, `define:vars`) for proper SSG handling
- Conditional loading: GA4 scripts only inject when env var is present
- Updated `.env.example:9-12` with GA4 configuration instructions

**2. Full BaseLayout Refactor:**
- **Problem discovered**: Homepage, about, episodes list, and 404 pages didn't use BaseLayout
- **Root cause**: Pages imported Header/Footer directly, bypassing BaseLayout GA4 integration
- **Solution**: Refactored all 4 pages to use BaseLayout pattern

  **Pages refactored:**
  - `src/pages/404.astro` - 53 lines → 40 lines (removed duplicate HTML structure)
  - `src/pages/about.astro` - 105 lines → 123 lines (removed SITE_CONFIG, added RSS feed button, dynamic subscribe section based on `isActive`)
  - `src/pages/episodes/index.astro` - 105 lines → 93 lines (removed duplicate HTML)
  - `src/pages/index.astro` - 135 lines → 122 lines (removed duplicate HTML)

**3. About Page Improvements:**
- Removed outdated `SITE_CONFIG` import (hardcoded data)
- Now fetches all data from Sanity via `getPodcastInfo()`
- Added RSS feed button (orange, matching episode pages)
- Added dynamic messaging based on `isActive` status:
  - Active: "Subscribe to [siteName]" / "Get notified when new episodes are released"
  - Inactive: "Listen to [siteName]" / "Explore the complete archive on your favorite platform"
- Changed contact from email to X/Twitter link

**4. Code Cleanup:**
- Removed debug `console.log` from `BaseLayout.astro:23`
- All pages now share consistent SEO meta tags via BaseLayout props
- Dynamic favicon from Sanity CMS on all pages
- Eliminated duplicate `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>` tags across site

**5. Build & Verification:**
- Clean build: 72 pages in 9.80s (no errors)
- Verified GA4 script on all key pages: `dist/404.html`, `dist/about/index.html`, `dist/episodes/index.html`, `dist/index.html`
- All pages now have Google Analytics tracking

### Files Modified

**GA4 Integration:**
- `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro:22,54-60` - Added GA4 script loading
- `.env:9` - Added `PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-V74NXPXZWQ`
- `.env.example:9-12` - Added GA4 configuration with instructions

**BaseLayout Refactor:**
- `src/pages/404.astro` - Converted to BaseLayout (53→40 lines)
- `src/pages/about.astro` - Converted to BaseLayout, removed SITE_CONFIG, added RSS, dynamic subscribe (105→123 lines)
- `src/pages/episodes/index.astro` - Converted to BaseLayout (105→93 lines)
- `src/pages/index.astro` - Converted to BaseLayout (135→122 lines)

### Technical Decisions

**1. Full BaseLayout Refactor (Not Piecemeal)**
- Rationale: GA4 needs to be on ALL pages for accurate analytics
- Alternative considered: Add GA4 to individual pages (rejected - duplicate code)
- Implementation: Converted all 4 remaining pages to use BaseLayout
- Trade-off: Slightly more work upfront, but DRY principle and centralized SEO
- Result: All 72 pages now have GA4, consistent meta tags, dynamic favicon

**2. Remove SITE_CONFIG from About Page**
- Rationale: Hardcoded configuration is outdated pattern, should use Sanity
- Alternative: Keep SITE_CONFIG (rejected - inconsistent with rest of site)
- Implementation: Replaced with `getPodcastInfo()` Sanity query
- Result: About page now fully CMS-driven like other pages

**3. Conditional GA4 Loading**
- Rationale: Don't break builds if GA4 ID not present
- Implementation: `{GA_MEASUREMENT_ID && <script>...}`
- Benefit: Framework works without GA4, but adds tracking when configured

### Current State

**Phase 1 Complete! ✅**
- All 72 pages built successfully
- Google Analytics 4 tracking on every page
- All pages use BaseLayout (consistent SEO, meta tags, favicon)
- About page fully CMS-driven
- Clean build with zero errors
- RSS feed button on about page

**Sanity CMS Data:**
- 68 episodes with hosts (Rex Kirshner)
- 72 guests linked to 63 episodes
- 66 episode covers uploaded (missing: 0, 40)
- 65 guest photos uploaded
- Full podcast metadata (name, tagline, description, social links, isActive status)

**Code Quality:**
- No duplicate HTML structure
- Centralized SEO meta tags
- Dynamic favicon from CMS
- Environment-based configuration (GA4)
- DRY principle enforced

### Next Steps

**Immediate (ready to start Phase 2):**
1. Push all changes to GitHub
2. Update context system documentation
3. Evaluate Claude Context System upgrade
4. Plan Phase 2 features

**Phase 2 Planning:**
- Newsletter integration (ConvertKit)
- Automated episode artwork import (Spotify Web API)
- Transcript generation (OpenAI Whisper)
- Advanced analytics (Sentry error monitoring)

### Notes

**Phase 1 Scope Complete:**
- ✅ Core framework (Astro + Tailwind + Sanity)
- ✅ CMS customization (favicon, podcast info, social links, RSS)
- ✅ SEO meta tags (Open Graph, Twitter Cards)
- ✅ Google Analytics 4 (all 72 pages)
- ✅ Full BaseLayout refactor (code quality)

## Session 11 - 2025-10-06 21:00

**Focus:** Pods.media Integration Research + Featured Episodes Carousel Refinement + Comprehensive Code Review

**Phase:** Phase 2a - Core Features Development
**Status:** ✅ Research Complete, Code Review Complete, Context Saved

### Accomplishments

**1. Pods.media Integration Research (2 hours)**
- Investigated pods.media platform for NFT-based podcast episode collecting
- Key findings:
  - Web3 podcast platform with 75+ shows, $1M+ in episode mints, 120k+ collectors
  - No public API available (partnership/onboarding required)
  - Episodes minted as NFTs stored on Arweave
  - Platform features: leaderboards, social sharing, wallet integration
- Created comprehensive integration report: `context/tasks/pods-media-integration-research.md`
- Documented 3-tier implementation approach (testing → basic → advanced)
- Identified pros/cons and alternative platforms (Sound.xyz, RSS3, Zora, Lens Protocol)
- Recommendation: Low-effort Tier 1 testing first (apply for onboarding, monitor results)

**2. Featured Episodes Carousel Redesign**
- User requested one-episode-at-a-time layout (was showing 3 at once)
- Redesigned carousel to horizontal split layout:
  - Left: Episode cover image (256px) or podcast logo fallback
  - Right: Host/guests at top, description below
- Updated carousel JavaScript to always show 1 item (`itemsPerView = 1`)
- Removed responsive breakpoint logic (no longer needed)
- Modified: `src/components/FeaturedEpisodesCarousel.astro:40-187`

**3. Comprehensive Code Review**
- Ran full codebase audit (no changes made, analysis only)
- Reviewed 14 source files (~1,833 lines of code)
- Generated detailed report: `artifacts/code-reviews/session-11-review.md`
- **Grade:** B+ (85/100)
- **Issues Found:** 0 critical, 2 high, 6 medium, 8 low
- Top recommendations:
  1. Add error handling to Sanity API calls (H1)
  2. Implement loading states for async fetching (H2)
  3. Write unit tests for utility functions (M1)
- Noted excellent architecture, clean code, good SEO foundation
- Identified gaps: no tests (0% coverage), missing error boundaries

### Files Modified/Created

**Research & Documentation:**
- `context/tasks/pods-media-integration-research.md` - 10k+ word integration analysis with tier approach, pros/cons, alternatives
- `artifacts/code-reviews/session-11-review.md` - Comprehensive code quality audit with 16 documented issues

**Carousel Refinement:**
- `src/components/FeaturedEpisodesCarousel.astro:11-120` - Changed to one-at-a-time layout with horizontal split
  - Added `getPodcastInfo()` import for logo fallback
  - Redesigned card structure: image left, content (host/guests/description) right
  - Updated container width to `max-w-5xl` (was `max-w-7xl`)
- `src/components/FeaturedEpisodesCarousel.astro:122-187` - Simplified carousel JavaScript
  - Set `itemsPerView = 1` (constant, not responsive)
  - Removed `updateItemsPerView()` function
  - Simplified offset calculation (no gap needed for single item)

### Technical Decisions

**1. Pods.media Integration Approach: Tier 1 First**
- Rationale: No public API means low-effort testing is required before deeper investment
- Alternative considered: Build unofficial integration (rejected - ToS risk, unsupported)
- Implementation plan:
  1. Apply for onboarding with Pods.media team
  2. Add simple collect links to 2-3 episodes
  3. Monitor metrics for 30 days
  4. Proceed to Tier 2 only if collections > 100
- Trade-off: Slower integration, but validates ROI before engineering effort

**2. Single-Item Carousel (Not Responsive Multi-Item)**
- Rationale: User feedback - 3 items at once felt too crowded
- Alternative considered: Keep responsive layout (rejected - user preference)
- Implementation: Always show 1 episode with generous whitespace
- Result: Cleaner design, more focus on featured episode details

**3. Code Review Without Changes**
- Rationale: Separate analysis from fixes prevents scope creep
- Process: Document all issues in report, address in future session
- Benefit: Thorough analysis without time pressure, clear prioritization
- Result: 16 issues documented with effort estimates, can tackle incrementally

### Current State

**Phase 2a Progress:**
- ✅ Guests page with navigation links
- ✅ Guest detail pages
- ✅ Featured episodes carousel (refined to 1-item layout)
- ⏸️ Pods.media integration (research complete, awaiting user decision)
- ⏸️ CMS-driven styling (deferred)
- ⏸️ Guest filtering/search (optional, deferred)

**Code Quality:**
- Overall grade: B+ (solid foundation, some improvements needed)
- Zero critical issues (production-ready)
- High-priority items: Error handling, loading states
- Medium-priority items: Tests, accessibility, XSS hardening
- Low-priority items: Code cleanup, consistency improvements

**Documentation:**
- Pods.media integration fully researched and documented
- Code review complete with actionable recommendations
- Context system up to date

### Work In Progress

**Carousel Tweaks (In Progress):**
- Current state: Carousel shows 1 episode at a time with horizontal layout
- User may request additional refinements (spacing, sizing, animation)
- Resume point: Wait for user feedback on current design at http://localhost:4321/

**Next Actions Pending User Input:**
1. Review pods.media integration report - decide if pursuing Tier 1
2. Review code review report - prioritize issues to fix
3. Continue carousel tweaks if needed
4. Move to CMS-driven styling (Phase 2a next feature)

### Next Steps

**Immediate (After User Review):**
1. Await user feedback on current carousel design
2. If approved, commit carousel changes
3. Review pods.media report together, decide on Tier 1 pursuit
4. Review code review findings, prioritize fixes

**Phase 2a Remaining:**
1. CMS-driven styling (logo, colors, fonts)
2. Optional: Guest filtering/search functionality
3. Optional: Address high-priority code review items (error handling, tests)

**Phase 2b (Future):**
1. Framework generalization (templatize for multi-podcast deployment)
2. Address medium-priority code review items
3. Performance optimization if needed

### Notes

**Pods.media Key Insights:**
- Platform is proven (75+ podcasts, $1M+ minted) but lacks public API
- Strange Water Podcast may already be listed (need to verify)
- Integration path requires partnership, not self-service
- Alternative platforms exist (Sound.xyz, Zora, Lens) if Pods doesn't work out
- Best approach: Low commitment test first, scale if successful

**Code Review Highlights:**
- Excellent architecture and code organization
- TypeScript types well-defined, Sanity queries centralized
- SEO foundation strong, performance-oriented
- Biggest gap: Zero test coverage (highest priority to address)
- Security: Good but can be better (XSS risks if CMS compromised)

**Session Duration:** ~3 hours
- Pods.media research: 2 hours
- Carousel refinement: 30 minutes
- Code review: 1.5 hours
- Context saving: 30 minutes
