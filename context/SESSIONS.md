## Session 2025-10-05A: Context System Initialization

**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Phase:** Pre-Implementation Setup
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### What We Did

**1. Evaluated Claude Context System:**
- Reviewed https://github.com/rexkirshner/claude-context-system
- Assessed fit for 60-day, 120+ task project
- Decision: Install (high complexity, perfect use case)

**2. Installed Context System:**
- Cloned repository, copied `.claude/` and `scripts/` to project
- Created context directory structure:
  - `context/` (documentation)
  - `context/tasks/` (action tracking)
  - `artifacts/` (code reviews, performance reports, etc.)

**3. Configured Project:**
- Updated `.context-config.json` with project metadata
- Set owner: Rex Kirshner
- Set project name: Podcast Website Framework
- Set type: web-app
- Configured workflow preferences (approval required, no push without approval, etc.)

**4. Created Core Documentation:**
- `CLAUDE.md` - Developer guide (tech stack, methodology, commands, preferences)
- `SESSIONS.md` - This file (session history tracking)
- Ready to create task files next

### Decisions Made

**1. Use Minimal Init (Not Full):**
- Rationale: Start with 3 core files (CLAUDE.md, SESSIONS.md, tasks/), grow as needed
- PRD.md already exists at root, no need to duplicate
- ARCHITECTURE.md, DECISIONS.md can be added later if complexity requires

**2. Separate Sanity Project Per Podcast:**
- Each podcast gets own Sanity project (separate project IDs, datasets)
- Benefits: Clean permissions, no cross-contamination, isolated scaling
- Trade-off: Slightly more setup per podcast (acceptable for 4-hour deployment goal)

**3. Scheduled Publishing Strategy:**
- Phase 1 (MVP): Manual publish only (mark as "Scheduled" but manually publish)
- Phase 2: Implement Sanity Scheduled Publishing plugin (automated timed releases)
- Rationale: Keep MVP simple, add automation when proven needed

### Current State

**Project Structure:**
```
podcast website/
├── .claude/                    # Context system commands & docs
├── archive/                    # Pre-project PRD drafts (v1-v6)
├── context/                    # Living documentation (NEW)
│   ├── .context-config.json   # Project configuration
│   ├── CLAUDE.md              # Developer guide
│   ├── SESSIONS.md            # This file
│   └── tasks/                 # Action tracking (to be created)
├── scripts/                    # Validation scripts
├── artifacts/                  # Code reviews, performance reports (NEW)
├── PRD.md                      # Final PRD (1,239 lines)
└── IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md      # Task breakdown (679 lines, 120+ tasks)
```

**Phase:** Pre-Implementation
**Next Milestone:** Day 1 - Project Setup & First Deploy
**Ready to Code:** Yes

### Next Session

**Primary Goal:** Begin Day 1 implementation (Project Setup & First Deploy)

**Morning Tasks (Day 1):**
- [ ] Task 1.1: Create GitHub repository `podcast-framework`
- [ ] Task 1.2: Run `npm create astro@latest`
- [ ] Task 1.3: Install Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Task 1.4-1.6: Environment setup, README, initial commit

**Afternoon Tasks (Day 1):**
- [ ] Task 1.7-1.9: Netlify setup, deployment
- [ ] Task 1.10-1.11: Verify site, configure staging subdomain

**End of Day 1 Goal:** Deployed site accessible at staging URL, auto-deploy working

### Notes

- Multiple `.claude/` directories detected in parent folders (claude admin, inevitable eth, personal website, podcast website)
- Not a blocker for this project, but noted for awareness
- Context system commands may need Claude Code restart to be recognized as slash commands
- For now, manually executing command workflows is working fine

## Session 2025-10-05B: Day 1 - Project Setup & First Deploy

**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Phase:** Phase 1a - "Hello World" Deployed Site
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### What We Did

**1. GitHub Repository:**
- Created repository: `podcast-framework`
- Repository URL: https://github.com/rexkirshner/podcast-framework
- Visibility: Public
- Description: "Reusable podcast website framework built with Astro, Sanity CMS, and Netlify. Deploy production-ready podcast sites in <4 hours."

**2. Astro Project Initialization:**
- Initialized Astro project with minimal template
- Configuration: TypeScript strict mode
- Workaround: Created in temp directory due to existing files, then moved to root
- Created files: `astro.config.mjs`, `package.json`, `src/pages/index.astro`, `tsconfig.json`

**3. Tailwind CSS Integration:**
- Installed Tailwind CSS v4 via Astro integration (`npx astro add tailwind`)
- Auto-configured `astro.config.mjs` with Vite plugin
- Created `src/styles/global.css` with Tailwind imports

**4. Project Configuration:**
- Created `.env.example` with placeholders for Sanity config, analytics, monitoring
- Updated `README.md` with comprehensive project documentation
- Git initialization: `git init`, added remote, initial commit

**5. Netlify Deployment:**
- Created Netlify account, connected to GitHub repository
- Auto-detected build settings (correct Astro defaults)
- Deployed successfully to `podcast-framework.netlify.app`
- Site verified loading (default Astro homepage)

**6. Custom Subdomain Configuration:**
- Configured `staging.strangewater.xyz` in Netlify
- Added DNS records in Cloudflare:
  - TXT record: `subdomain-owner-verification` → `87056d3b8f704ebdcb00be056a4b1121`
  - CNAME record: `staging` → `podcast-framework.netlify.app` (DNS only, not proxied)
- DNS propagation in progress (15-30 minutes expected)

### Files Modified/Created

**New files:**
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template
- `.gitignore` - Astro defaults
- `README.md` - Project documentation (125 lines)
- `astro.config.mjs` - Astro + Tailwind configuration
- `package.json` - Dependencies (Astro 5.1.4, Tailwind 4.1.14)
- `src/pages/index.astro` - Default homepage
- `src/styles/global.css` - Tailwind imports
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration

**Git commits:**
- `f9800df` - Initial project setup: Astro + Tailwind + Context System (50 files, 27,005 insertions)

### Decisions Made

**1. Astro Installation Workaround:**
- Problem: `npm create astro@latest .` failed due to non-empty directory
- Solution: Created in `temp-astro/`, moved files to root, cleaned up
- Rationale: Preserves existing context system and documentation files

**2. Cloudflare Proxy Configuration:**
- Decision: Disabled Cloudflare proxy for `staging` subdomain (gray cloud, "DNS only")
- Rationale: Netlify needs direct DNS access for SSL certificate provisioning
- Trade-off: Lose Cloudflare CDN/DDoS protection for staging (acceptable for internal staging site)

```

**Deployment Status:**
- ✅ GitHub repository: https://github.com/rexkirshner/podcast-framework
- ✅ Netlify deployment: https://podcast-framework.netlify.app (live)
- 🚧 Custom subdomain: https://staging.strangewater.xyz (DNS propagating, 15-30 min)

**Phase:** Phase 1a - "Hello World" Deployed Site (Day 1 complete)
**Next Milestone:** Day 2 - First Episode Page (Hardcoded)

### Work In Progress

**None** - All Day 1 tasks complete. Ready for Day 2.

### Next Session

**Primary Goal:** Day 2 - First Episode Page (Hardcoded)

**Morning Tasks (Day 2):**
- [ ] Task 2.1: Create hardcoded episode page layout (`/episodes/1`)
- [ ] Task 2.2: Add basic header component
- [ ] Task 2.3: Add basic footer component
- [ ] Task 2.4: Embed Spotify audio player (iframe)
- [ ] Task 2.5: Style with Tailwind CSS

**Afternoon Tasks (Day 2):**
- [ ] Task 2.6: Test audio playback
- [ ] Task 2.7: Deploy to staging
- [ ] Task 2.8: Verify responsive design
- [ ] Task 2.9: Update homepage to link to episode

**End of Day 2 Goal:** Deployed site with 1 working episode page, playable audio

### Notes

- DNS propagation for `staging.strangewater.xyz` verified via `dig` - CNAME correct, resolves to Netlify IPs
- Netlify will auto-provision SSL certificate once DNS fully propagates globally
- GitHub → Netlify auto-deploy pipeline working (push to `main` triggers production build)
- No branch strategy implemented yet (single `main` branch, will add `develop` for staging in Phase 1b)
