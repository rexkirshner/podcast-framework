## Current Phase

**Phase:** Phase 2c - Production Operations & Hosting Portability
**Status:** ✅ Cloudflare Pages Migration Complete | ✅ All Features Working | 🎯 Ready for Feature Development
**Next Milestone:** Continue Phase 2a feature development (transcripts, search, platform links)

> **Strategic Decision (2025-10-07):** Roadmap reevaluation reveals templatization was scheduled too early. Recommendation: Build 3-4 high-impact features FIRST (transcripts, search, platform links), THEN templatize for maximum template value.
>
> **Critical Protocol (2025-10-07):** NEVER push to GitHub without explicit user permission (triggers Netlify builds, consumes quota). Documented in `context/meta/claude-context-feedback.md`.

## Recent Decisions

### D-Cloudflare-Migration (2025-10-09)
**Decision:** Execute immediate Cloudflare Pages migration
**Rationale:** Abstraction layer ready, unlimited bandwidth, faster cold starts (~5ms), same $0 cost
**Implementation:** 4 hours total (including troubleshooting and documentation)
**Impact:** Migration successful, hosting abstraction validated (29 hours saved, 93% effort reduction)
**Outcome:** All features working, site live on Cloudflare Pages
**Documented:** SESSIONS.md Session 19

### D-GitPush-Enforcement (2025-10-09)
**Decision:** User selected Option 1 workflow (commit freely, always ask before push)
**Rationale:** Prevents unauthorized deployments, gives user control over production timing
**Implementation:** Followed strictly in Session 19 (asked permission before every push)
**Impact:** No more git push protocol violations
**Documented:** `context/claude-context-feedback.md:94-196`

### D-Hosting-Abstraction (2025-10-08)
**Decision:** Implement abstraction layer (Option A) before any migration
**Rationale:** Reduces vendor lock-in from 6/10 → 3/10, cuts future migration effort 74% (31 hours → 8 hours)
**Implementation:** Sprint 1 (extract logic) + Sprint 2 (add adapters) = completed in Session 17
**Impact:** Made Cloudflare migration possible in 4 hours instead of 31 hours
**Documented:** `context/tasks/hosting-migration-analysis.md`

### D-Pre-Refactor-Checkpoint (2025-10-08)
**Decision:** Save context checkpoint before major refactor begins
**Rationale:** Large codebase changes require safe restore point
**Implementation:** /save-context command with comprehensive Session 17 documentation
**Impact:** Can confidently revert if refactor encounters issues
**Documented:** Session 17 in SESSIONS.md

### D-GitPush-Protocol-Update (2025-10-08)
**Decision:** Document 3rd unauthorized push with root cause analysis and solutions
**Rationale:** Pattern of violations requires systemic fix, not just awareness
**Proposed Solutions:** Pre-push checklist, approval flag, commit-only mode, layered defense
**Impact:** Needs integration into Claude Context System for enforcement
**Documented:** `context/claude-context-feedback.md:1055-1476`

### D-GitPush (2025-10-07)
**Decision:** NEVER push to GitHub without explicit user permission
**Rationale:** Git push triggers Netlify auto-build, consuming build minutes from monthly quota (50% consumed in 1 day during Session 14)
**Impact:** Cost control, user approval required
**Documented:** `context/claude-context-feedback.md`

## Next Steps

### For User (Immediate)
1. **Review hosting migration analysis** (`context/tasks/hosting-migration-analysis.md`)
   - 4 providers compared with pricing, risks, switching costs
   - Abstraction strategy detailed (4 phases, 20-28 hours)
   - Recommendation: Option A (abstraction layer)
2. **Review context checkpoint** (SESSIONS.md Session 17)
   - DNS migration and contribute fix documented
   - Git push protocol violation #3 analysis
   - Ready to proceed with Sprint 1 refactor
3. **Approve git commit** of Session 17 work:
   - Contribute serverless fix
   - Hosting migration analysis (2,290 lines)
   - Git protocol documentation
   - Context updates (SESSIONS.md, STATUS.md)
   - **CRITICAL:** Verify will NOT push to GitHub

### For Next Session (Sprint 1 - After User Approval)
1. **Create `src/server/` directory structure:**
   - `services/` (business logic)
   - `adapters/` (provider interfaces)
   - `utils/` (shared utilities)

2. **Extract newsletter business logic:**
   - Create `src/server/services/newsletter-service.ts`
   - Move ConvertKit API logic from `netlify/functions/newsletter-subscribe.ts`
   - Add unit tests (vitest)

3. **Extract contribution business logic:**
   - Create `src/server/services/contribution-service.ts`
   - Move Sanity/Resend logic from `netlify/functions/contribute.ts`
   - Add unit tests (vitest)

4. **Update Netlify functions to thin wrappers:**
   - Keep only HTTP handling and Netlify-specific types
   - Call services for business logic
   - Maintain exact same functionality

5. **Deploy and verify:**
   - Build succeeds
   - All forms work (contribute, newsletter)
   - No regressions

### Long-term (Post-Features, Pre-Templatization)
1. Address high-priority code review issues (H1-H5)
2. Add unit tests for critical paths (improve from 5% coverage)
3. Fix hardcoded values (template readiness)
4. Execute templatization plan (Phase 2b)
