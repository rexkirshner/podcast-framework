**Current:** Week 9 Complete - Framework Validated! | **Session:** 20 | **Progress:** 64% (9 of 14 weeks complete)

### Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Astro 5.1.1 with SSR + Static Hybrid
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Database:** Sanity CMS (headless)
- **Hosting:** Cloudflare Pages (migrated from Netlify 2025-10-09)
- **Email:** Resend (transactional), ConvertKit (newsletter)
- **Analytics:** Google Analytics 4
- **Testing:** Vitest (40 passing tests)

### URLs

- **Production:** https://strangewater.xyz (Cloudflare Pages)
- **Sanity Studio:** https://strangewaterpodcast.sanity.studio
- **Repository:** https://github.com/rexkirshner/podcast-framework
- **Local Dev:** http://localhost:4321

### Current Focus

**Phase:** Phase 2c - Production Operations & Hosting Portability
**Status:** ✅ Cloudflare Migration Complete | ✅ All Features Working

**Active Tasks:**
1. Production validation (test all features on Cloudflare)
2. Hosting cleanup (decommission Netlify if stable)
3. Context documentation (auto-generating QUICK_REF.md)

**Next Priority:** Continue Phase 2a feature development (transcripts, search, platform links)

### Quick Commands

```bash

npm run dev:sanity       # Start Sanity Studio (localhost:3333)

# Build & Deploy
npm run build            # Build for production
npm run preview          # Preview production build locally

# Sanity Data Management
npm run import:episodes  # Import episodes from RSS feed
npm run init:theme       # Initialize/update theme in Sanity
npm run upload:photos    # Upload guest photos to Sanity

# Testing

```

### Context Navigation

- **Orientation:** `context/CONTEXT.md` - Project setup, architecture, methodology
- **Current Status:** `context/STATUS.md` - Current state, active tasks, blockers
- **Decision Log:** `context/DECISIONS.md` - Technical decisions with rationale
- **Session History:** `context/SESSIONS.md` - Comprehensive work log (19 sessions)
- **Claude Pointer:** `context/claude.md` - Claude Code entry point

### Key Architecture Points

**Hosting Abstraction Layer:**
- Location: `src/lib/hosting-adapter.ts`
- Purpose: Platform-agnostic environment variables, service config, error logging
- Benefit: Cloudflare migration took 4 hours instead of 31 hours (93% effort reduction)

**Serverless Functions:**
- Contribute form: `/api/contribute` (Cloudflare Pages Function)
- Newsletter signup: `/api/newsletter-subscribe` (Cloudflare Pages Function)
- Business logic: `src/server/services/` (portable across all platforms)

**Content Management:**
- 69 episodes, 72 guests, 65 guest photos
- CMS-driven theming (colors, fonts, layout)
- Build-time data fetching with 5-min cache TTL

### Recent Milestones

---

## Recent Decisions

### D27 - Component Count (2025-10-14 - Autonomous Sprint)
**Decision:** Extract 8 components (exceeded target of 5+)
**Rationale:** All essential components from Strange Water provide comprehensive starter kit
**Impact:** Framework more complete out of the box
**Documented:** SESSIONS.md Session 20 - Autonomous Sprint

### D26 - Inline Carousel Logic (2025-10-14 - Autonomous Sprint)
**Decision:** Inline carousel.ts script into FeaturedEpisodesCarousel component
**Rationale:** Makes component self-contained, no external script dependency
**Impact:** Easier to use, simpler for podcasts
**Documented:** SESSIONS.md Session 20 - Autonomous Sprint

### D25 - Hosting Adapter Extraction (2025-10-14 - Autonomous Sprint)
**Decision:** Extract hosting-adapter.ts to framework core
**Rationale:** Enables multi-cloud support out of the box, validates architecture from planning
**Impact:** Podcasts get Cloudflare/Netlify/Vercel compatibility immediately
**Documented:** SESSIONS.md Session 20 - Autonomous Sprint

### D24 - Open Source License (2025-10-14)
**Decision:** MIT License for all framework packages
**Rationale:** Maximum adoption, commercial use allowed, can still monetize via premium themes/support
**Alternatives:** Apache 2.0 (patent protection), GPL (copyleft)
**Impact:** Open source with no restrictions, familiar to developers
**Documented:** SESSIONS.md Session 20

### D23 - Repository Structure (2025-10-14)
**Decision:** 3 separate repos (podcast-framework monorepo, podcast-template, podcast-framework-docs)
**Rationale:** Clean separation, GitHub template feature needs separate repo, docs deployed independently
**Automated sync:** GitHub Actions updates template when packages publish
**Documented:** templatization-plan-v2.1-FINAL.md

### D22 - Sanity Schema Strategy (2025-10-14)
**Decision:** Hybrid extensible with versioned packages
**Approach:** Framework ships @podcast-framework/sanity-schema-v2, podcasts extend with custom fields, migrations are manual but CLI-generated templates
**Why NOT auto-migrations:** Cannot infer domain-specific transforms, requires human review for safety
**Documented:** templatization-plan-v2.1-FINAL.md Section 4

### D21 - Component Override System (2025-10-14)
**Decision:** Hybrid auto-resolution + slots
**Implementation:** Framework uses import.meta.glob to check local overrides first, fallback to framework. Also provides slots for per-page customization.
**Why import.meta.glob:** Dynamic imports fail in production builds, need statically analyzable approach
**Documented:** templatization-plan-v2.1-FINAL.md Section 3

### D20 - NPM Package Architecture (2025-10-14)
**Decision:** NPM package pattern (not git fork/template)
**Rationale:** Industry standard, semantic versioning, no merge conflicts, TypeScript support
**Rejected:** Git fork approach due to merge conflict hell and versioning complexity
**Impact:** Framework lives in node_modules, updates via npm
**Documented:** templatization-plan-v2.1-FINAL.md Section 1

### D-GitPush-Enforcement (2025-10-09)
**Decision:** User selected Option 1 workflow (commit freely, always ask before push)
**Rationale:** Prevents unauthorized deployments, gives user control over production timing
**Implementation:** Followed strictly in Session 19 (asked permission before every push)
**Impact:** No more git push protocol violations
**Documented:** `context/claude-context-feedback.md:94-196`

### D-Hosting-Abstraction (2025-10-08)
**Decision:** Implement abstraction layer (Option A) before any migration
**Rationale:** Reduces vendor lock-in from 6/10 → 3/10, cuts future migration effort 74% (31 hours → 8 hours)
**Implementation:** Sprint 1 (extract logic) + Sprint 2 (add adapters) = completed in Session 17
**Impact:** Made Cloudflare migration possible in 4 hours instead of 31 hours
**Documented:** `context/tasks/hosting-migration-analysis.md`

### D-Pre-Refactor-Checkpoint (2025-10-08)
**Decision:** Save context checkpoint before major refactor begins
**Rationale:** Large codebase changes require safe restore point
**Implementation:** /save-context command with comprehensive Session 17 documentation
**Impact:** Can confidently revert if refactor encounters issues
**Documented:** Session 17 in SESSIONS.md

### D-GitPush-Protocol-Update (2025-10-08)
**Decision:** Document 3rd unauthorized push with root cause analysis and solutions
**Rationale:** Pattern of violations requires systemic fix, not just awareness
**Proposed Solutions:** Pre-push checklist, approval flag, commit-only mode, layered defense
**Impact:** Needs integration into Claude Context System for enforcement
**Documented:** `context/claude-context-feedback.md:1055-1476`

### D-GitPush (2025-10-07)
**Decision:** NEVER push to GitHub without explicit user permission
**Rationale:** Git push triggers Netlify auto-build, consuming build minutes from monthly quota (50% consumed in 1 day during Session 14)
**Impact:** Cost control, user approval required
**Documented:** `context/claude-context-feedback.md`

## Next Steps

### Next Session (Phase 1 Week 1 Continuation)

1. **Set up TypeScript configuration:**
   - Create `packages/core/tsconfig.json`
   - Configure for Astro components
   - Enable strict mode

2. **Extract first component (Header.astro):**
   - Copy from `/Users/rexkirshner/coding/podcast-website/src/components/Header.astro`
   - Remove Strange Water-specific branding
   - Add props for configuration
   - Test renders with mock data

3. **Implement component resolver:**
   - Create `packages/core/src/lib/component-resolver.ts`
   - Use `import.meta.glob` for bundler safety (NOT dynamic imports)
   - Test local override mechanism
   - Verify works in both dev and production builds

4. **Create example podcast:**
   - Set up in `examples/basic/`
   - Install @podcast-framework/core (local link)
   - Test Header component renders
   - Verify override mechanism works

5. **Write unit tests:**
   - Test Header component
   - Test component resolver
   - Achieve >80% coverage goal

### Upcoming Phases
