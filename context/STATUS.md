## Current Phase

**Phase:** Phase 2a - Feature Development & Code Quality
**Status:** ‚úÖ Community Feature Complete | ‚úÖ Code Review 100% Complete | üéØ Production Ready
**Next Milestone:** Deploy to production OR implement Tier 1 features (transcripts, search)

> **Strategic Decision (2025-10-07):** Roadmap reevaluation reveals templatization was scheduled too early. Recommendation: Build 3-4 high-impact features FIRST (transcripts, search, platform links), THEN templatize for maximum template value.
>
> **Critical Protocol (2025-10-07):** NEVER push to GitHub without explicit user permission (triggers Netlify builds, consumes quota). Documented in `context/meta/claude-context-feedback.md`.

## Active Tasks

### Immediate Priorities (This Week)
1. **Newsletter Feature Decision** - User to decide:
   - Implement in Phase 2a (before templatization) OR defer to Phase 3?
   - If approved: 12-18 hours implementation time, $0-9/month cost
   - Plan ready at `context/tasks/newsletter-plan.md`
   - Decision factors: Strange Water archived (doesn't need it), but high template value

2. **Review Roadmap Evaluation** - User to read `context/tasks/roadmap-evaluation.md` and decide:
   - Which Tier 1 features to build before templatization?
   - Transcripts (highest ROI for SEO, $25 cost)
   - Episode search (4-6 hours, high UX value)
   - Platform links manual phase (4 hours)
   - Newsletter (if approved - 12-18 hours)

3. **Git Push Approval** - Ready to push Session 16 changes:
   - Newsletter plan + PRD updates
   - Recovered claude-context-feedback.md
   - Awaiting explicit user permission per critical protocol

### Pre-Templatization Features (Roadmap Tier 1)
- [ ] Fix contribution email notifications (blocked on user decision)
- [ ] Episode transcripts via Whisper API (10-15 hours, $25 for 69 episodes)
- [ ] Episode search functionality (4-6 hours, client-side)
- [ ] Episode platform links - Phase 1 manual (4 hours, CSV import)
- [ ] Address code review issues (Critical + High = ~8 hours)

### Phase 2b - Framework Templatization (After Feature Development)
- [ ] Fix hardcoded values (H4, H5 from code review)
- [ ] Environment variable extraction
- [ ] Template verification script
- [ ] Deployment guide with security & time-tracking
- [ ] TEMPLATE_VERSION.json + CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Git tag v2.0.0

---

## Work In Progress

**Current Task:** Newsletter planning complete, awaiting /code-review and git push approval

**What's Done (Session 16):**
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive newsletter implementation plan (470 lines, production-grade)
- ‚úÖ External AI security review incorporated (6 improvement categories)
- ‚úÖ PRD updated with newsletter tasks in Phase 2a roadmap
- ‚úÖ Recovered claude-context-feedback.md from git history
- ‚úÖ Newsletter architecture decided: Hybrid Sanity + ConvertKit

**Ready for Review:**
- Newsletter plan at `context/tasks/newsletter-plan.md`
- PRD Phase 2a section updated with implementation details
- All Session 16 changes uncommitted (awaiting /code-review completion)

**Next Specific Actions:**
1. Run /code-review to audit codebase
2. Add any feedback to claude-context-feedback.md
3. Commit Session 16 changes (newsletter plan, PRD, recovered file)
4. Request user permission to push to GitHub
5. User decides on newsletter implementation timing (Phase 2a vs Phase 3)

---

## Blockers

**None** - All blockers resolved:
- ‚úÖ Community feature implementation decision (decided: implement now)
- ‚úÖ Roadmap evaluation (completed in Session 14)
- ‚úÖ Code review (completed in Session 14)
- ‚è≥ Email notification (clear resolution path, awaiting user decision)

---

## Recent Decisions

### D-GitPush (2025-10-07)
**Decision:** NEVER push to GitHub without explicit user permission
**Rationale:** Git push triggers Netlify auto-build, consuming build minutes from monthly quota (50% consumed in 1 day during Session 14)
**Impact:** Cost control, user approval required
**Documented:** `context/meta/claude-context-feedback.md`

### D-RoadmapSequencing (2025-10-07)
**Decision:** Templatization scheduled too early; recommend building Tier 1 features first
**Rationale:** Template with transcripts, search, and platform links has 3-5x higher market value and saves time on all future deployments
**Recommended Sequence:** Fix contribution email ‚Üí Transcripts ‚Üí Search ‚Üí Platform links ‚Üí Address code review issues ‚Üí Templatize
**Documented:** `context/meta/tasks/roadmap-evaluation.md`

### D-ContributionFeature (2025-10-07)
**Decision:** Implement community contribution feature NOW (before templatization)
**Rationale:** User explicitly requested, high value for active podcasts, 95% complete
**Status:** Forms functional, Sanity writes working, email pending domain verification
**Documented:** Session 14 entry in SESSIONS.md

## Next Steps

### For User (Immediate)
1. **Review newsletter implementation plan** (`context/tasks/newsletter-plan.md`)
2. **Decide on newsletter timing:** Implement in Phase 2a OR defer to Phase 3?
3. Review roadmap evaluation report (`context/tasks/roadmap-evaluation.md`)
4. Review code review report (`artifacts/code-reviews/session-14-review.md`)
5. **Approve git push** of Session 16 work (newsletter plan, PRD update, recovered file)
6. Prioritize Tier 1 features for next session

### For Next Session (After User Decisions)
1. **If newsletter approved:** Implement in Phase 2a (12-18 hours)
   - Set up ConvertKit account and configure webhooks
   - Create Sanity subscriber schema with private dataset
   - Build API routes with Zod validation and rate limiting
   - Create NewsletterSignup.astro component with WCAG compliance
   - Comprehensive testing (integration tests, accessibility, monitoring)
2. **If newsletter deferred:** Move to Tier 1 features
   - Transcripts (highest priority, biggest SEO impact, $25 cost)
   - Episode search (high UX value, low complexity, 4-6 hours)
   - Platform links manual phase (4 hours)

### Long-term (Post-Features, Pre-Templatization)
1. Address high-priority code review issues (H1-H5)
2. Add unit tests for critical paths (improve from 5% coverage)
3. Fix hardcoded values (template readiness)
4. Execute templatization plan (Phase 2b)
