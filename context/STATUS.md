## Current Phase

**Phase:** Phase 2a - CMS Styling & Optional Features
**Status:** âœ… Theming Complete | ðŸ¤” Evaluating Community Contribution Feature
**Next Milestone:** Decide on community feature implementation (before or after templatization)

> **Strategic Decision (2025-10-06):** Build complete feature set FIRST (guests page + CMS styling), THEN templatize. This ensures Template v2.0.0 is feature-complete and enables config-only deployments.
>
> **New Feature Proposal (2025-10-07):** Community contribution system for active podcasts (episode ideas, guest requests, questions, feedback). See `context/tasks/requests-proposal.md` for comprehensive 13-page proposal.

## Work In Progress

**Current Task:** Evaluating community contribution feature proposal

**What's Done (Theme System):**
- âœ… Complete CMS-driven theming system
- âœ… Light theme with Strange Water branding (white bg, black header/footer, teal accents)
- âœ… Theme applied to all pages via BaseLayout
- âœ… Header/footer fully customizable via CMS
- âœ… All work committed to git (Session 12 commit d787750)

**What's Next:**
- Decision: Review community contribution proposal (context/tasks/requests-proposal.md)
- Option A: Implement now (8-12 hours) before templatization
- Option B: Add to template as included feature
- Option C: Skip for Strange Water, add only to future active podcasts

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority (Phase 2a - Decision Point)
1. **Review Community Contribution Proposal** (now)
   - Read `context/tasks/requests-proposal.md` (13-page comprehensive proposal)
   - Decide: Implement now vs. add to template vs. skip for Strange Water
   - Answer open questions:
     * Navigation label ("Contribute" or alternative)?
     * Email service (SendGrid vs Resend)?
     * Anonymous feedback (name/email optional)?
     * Notification frequency (immediate vs daily digest)?
     * Additional fields to collect?

2. **If Implementing Community Feature** (8-12 hours)
   - Phase 1: Core feature (Sanity schema, /contribute page, serverless function)
   - Phase 2: Notifications (email integration)
   - Phase 3: Polish (spam protection, privacy policy, mobile testing)

3. **Or, Move to Templatization** (Phase 2b)
   - Extract environment variables
   - Create template verification script
   - Document deployment guide
   - Tag v2.0.0

### Phase 2b - Framework Templatization (Week 7)
- Environment variable extraction
- Template verification script
- Deployment guide with security & time-tracking
- TEMPLATE_VERSION.json + CHANGELOG.md
- Git tag v2.0.0

### Phase 2c - Podcast #2 Deployment (Week 8)
- Clone template
- Deploy second podcast
- Validate <4h KPI
- Document improvements

## Blockers

**None currently.** All Phase 1 work complete. Ready for production deployment.

---

## Future Enhancements

### Brand Colors Customization via CMS (Phase 2)
**Current State:** Brand colors hardcoded in Tailwind CSS
**Desired State:** Primary/secondary/accent colors defined in Sanity CMS
**Implementation:** CSS custom properties or dynamic Tailwind config

### Episode Artwork Automation (Phase 2)
**Current Limitation:** Manual upload required for artwork
**Required Solutions:**
- Spotify Web API integration (recommended)
- Alternative RSS sources (fallback)
- Webhook-based automation (ideal)
