## Current Phase

**Phase:** Phase 2c - Production Operations & Hosting Portability
**Status:** ‚úÖ Production Live at strangewater.xyz | ‚úÖ Hosting Analysis Complete | üéØ Ready for Abstraction Refactor
**Next Milestone:** Implement hosting abstraction layer (Sprint 1: Extract business logic)

> **Strategic Decision (2025-10-07):** Roadmap reevaluation reveals templatization was scheduled too early. Recommendation: Build 3-4 high-impact features FIRST (transcripts, search, platform links), THEN templatize for maximum template value.
>
> **Critical Protocol (2025-10-07):** NEVER push to GitHub without explicit user permission (triggers Netlify builds, consumes quota). Documented in `context/meta/claude-context-feedback.md`.

## Active Tasks

### Immediate Priorities (This Week)
1. **Hosting Abstraction Refactor - Sprint 1** (12-16 hours):
   - Extract business logic from Netlify functions to `src/server/`
   - Create `newsletter-service.ts` with ConvertKit integration
   - Create `contribution-service.ts` with Sanity/Resend integration
   - Add unit tests for extracted services
   - Keep Netlify functions working as thin wrappers
   - Deploy and verify all features work (no migration yet)
   - **Goal:** Reduce vendor lock-in from 6/10 to 4/10

2. **Git Commit Ready** - Session 17 changes uncommitted:
   - Contribute button serverless fix
   - Hosting migration analysis (2,290 lines)
   - Git push protocol violation #3 documentation
   - **CRITICAL:** Commit only, do NOT push to GitHub (per protocol)

3. **Review Hosting Migration Analysis** - User to read `context/tasks/hosting-migration-analysis.md`:
   - 4 hosting providers compared (Netlify, Cloudflare, Vercel, AWS)
   - Abstraction strategy defined (4 phases)
   - Implementation plans for each provider
   - Decision: Proceed with Option A (abstraction layer)

### Hosting Abstraction Roadmap

- [ ] **Sprint 1:** Extract business logic to `src/server/` (12-16 hours) ‚Üê NEXT
- [ ] **Sprint 2:** Add provider adapter pattern (8-12 hours)
- [ ] **Phase 3:** Replace in-memory rate limiting with Upstash Redis (6-8 hours)
- [ ] **Phase 4:** Abstract configuration management (4-6 hours)

### Pre-Templatization Features (Deferred)
- [ ] Episode transcripts via Whisper API (10-15 hours, $25 for 69 episodes)
- [ ] Episode search functionality (4-6 hours, client-side)
- [ ] Episode platform links - Phase 1 manual (4 hours, CSV import)
- [ ] Newsletter feature implementation (12-18 hours, $0-9/month) - user decision pending

### Phase 2b - Framework Templatization (After Feature Development)
- [ ] Fix hardcoded values (H4, H5 from code review)
- [ ] Environment variable extraction
- [ ] Template verification script
- [ ] Deployment guide with security & time-tracking
- [ ] TEMPLATE_VERSION.json + CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Git tag v2.0.0

- `context/claude-context-feedback.md` - Git push protocol violation #3
- `context/SESSIONS.md` - Session 17 comprehensive entry
- `context/STATUS.md` - Updated current state

**Next Specific Actions:**

2. ‚úÖ Update STATUS.md with current state
3. Auto-generate QUICK_REF.md
4. Stage and commit all context files + code changes
5. **DO NOT PUSH** to GitHub (critical protocol)
6. Report completion to user
7. Await user approval to begin Sprint 1 refactor

## Blockers

**None** - All technical blockers resolved:
- ‚úÖ DNS migration completed (strangewater.xyz live)
- ‚úÖ Contribute button fixed (serverless compatibility)
- ‚úÖ Hosting analysis complete (ready for abstraction refactor)
- ‚è≥ Awaiting user approval to begin Sprint 1 refactor

---

## Recent Decisions

### D-Hosting-Abstraction (2025-10-08)
**Decision:** Implement abstraction layer (Option A) before any migration
**Rationale:** Reduces vendor lock-in from 6/10 ‚Üí 3/10, cuts future migration effort 74% (31 hours ‚Üí 8 hours)
**Implementation:** Sprint 1 (extract logic) + Sprint 2 (add adapters) = 20-28 hours total
**Impact:** Makes hosting provider swappable, enables confident future migration decisions
**Documented:** `context/tasks/hosting-migration-analysis.md`

### D-Pre-Refactor-Checkpoint (2025-10-08)
**Decision:** Save context checkpoint before major refactor begins
**Rationale:** Large codebase changes require safe restore point
**Implementation:** /save-context command with comprehensive Session 17 documentation
**Impact:** Can confidently revert if refactor encounters issues
**Documented:** Session 17 in SESSIONS.md

### D-GitPush-Protocol-Update (2025-10-08)
**Decision:** Document 3rd unauthorized push with root cause analysis and solutions
**Rationale:** Pattern of violations requires systemic fix, not just awareness
**Proposed Solutions:** Pre-push checklist, approval flag, commit-only mode, layered defense
**Impact:** Needs integration into Claude Context System for enforcement
**Documented:** `context/claude-context-feedback.md:1055-1476`

### D-GitPush (2025-10-07)
**Decision:** NEVER push to GitHub without explicit user permission
**Rationale:** Git push triggers Netlify auto-build, consuming build minutes from monthly quota (50% consumed in 1 day during Session 14)
**Impact:** Cost control, user approval required
**Documented:** `context/claude-context-feedback.md`

   - Keep only HTTP handling and Netlify-specific types
   - Call services for business logic
   - Maintain exact same functionality

5. **Deploy and verify:**
   - Build succeeds
   - All forms work (contribute, newsletter)
   - No regressions

### Long-term (Post-Features, Pre-Templatization)
1. Address high-priority code review issues (H1-H5)
2. Add unit tests for critical paths (improve from 5% coverage)
3. Fix hardcoded values (template readiness)
4. Execute templatization plan (Phase 2b)
