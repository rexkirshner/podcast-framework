**Last Updated:** 2025-10-07 (Session 14 - Community Feature Implementation & Roadmap Planning)

## Current Phase

**Phase:** Phase 2a - Feature Development & Roadmap Re-evaluation
**Status:** ‚úÖ Community Feature Implemented (95%) | üìä Roadmap Evaluated | üîç Code Reviewed
**Next Milestone:** Decide on pre-templatization feature set based on roadmap evaluation

> **Strategic Decision (2025-10-07):** Roadmap reevaluation reveals templatization was scheduled too early. Recommendation: Build 3-4 high-impact features FIRST (transcripts, search, platform links), THEN templatize for maximum template value.
>
> **Critical Protocol (2025-10-07):** NEVER push to GitHub without explicit user permission (triggers Netlify builds, consumes quota). Documented in `context/meta/claude-context-feedback.md`.

## Active Tasks

### Immediate Priorities (This Week)
1. **Email Notification Decision** - User to choose:
   - Option A: Change NOTIFICATION_EMAIL to Resend signup email (instant)
   - Option B: Verify rexkirshner.com domain in Resend (10 min, professional)

2. **Review Roadmap Evaluation** - User to read `context/meta/tasks/roadmap-evaluation.md` and decide:
   - Which Tier 1 features to build before templatization?
   - Transcripts (highest ROI for SEO, $25 cost)
   - Episode search (4-6 hours, high UX value)
   - Platform links manual phase (4 hours)

3. **Address Critical Security Issues** - From code review:
   - C1: XSS vulnerability in email generation (30 min fix)
   - C2: Email notifications (resolve with priority #1)

### Pre-Templatization Features (Roadmap Tier 1)
- [ ] Fix contribution email notifications (blocked on user decision)
- [ ] Episode transcripts via Whisper API (10-15 hours, $25 for 69 episodes)
- [ ] Episode search functionality (4-6 hours, client-side)
- [ ] Episode platform links - Phase 1 manual (4 hours, CSV import)
- [ ] Address code review issues (Critical + High = ~8 hours)

### Phase 2b - Framework Templatization (After Feature Development)
- [ ] Fix hardcoded values (H4, H5 from code review)
- [ ] Environment variable extraction
- [ ] Template verification script
- [ ] Deployment guide with security & time-tracking
- [ ] TEMPLATE_VERSION.json + CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Git tag v2.0.0

## Work In Progress

**Current Task:** Autonomous code sprint complete, awaiting user review and decisions

**What's Done (Session 14):**
- ‚úÖ Community contribution feature (95% complete)
- ‚úÖ Roadmap evaluation document
- ‚úÖ Code review report
- ‚úÖ Context documentation updated
- ‚úÖ Git commits prepared (NOT pushed - awaiting permission)

**Email Notification Blocker:**
- **Location:** `netlify/functions/contribute.ts:154-174`
- **Issue:** Resend 403 error - can only email signup address with test domain
- **Resolution:** User must choose Option A (change email) or B (verify domain)

**Next Specific Actions:**
1. User reviews roadmap evaluation (`context/meta/tasks/roadmap-evaluation.md`)
2. User reviews code review (`artifacts/code-reviews/session-14-review.md`)
3. User decides on email fix (A or B)
4. User approves git push of Session 14 work
5. User prioritizes Tier 1 features for implementation

---

## Blockers

**None** - All blockers resolved:
- ‚úÖ Community feature implementation decision (decided: implement now)
- ‚úÖ Roadmap evaluation (completed in Session 14)
- ‚úÖ Code review (completed in Session 14)
- ‚è≥ Email notification (clear resolution path, awaiting user decision)

---

## Recent Decisions

### D-GitPush (2025-10-07)
**Decision:** NEVER push to GitHub without explicit user permission
**Rationale:** Git push triggers Netlify auto-build, consuming build minutes from monthly quota (50% consumed in 1 day during Session 14)
**Impact:** Cost control, user approval required
**Documented:** `context/meta/claude-context-feedback.md`

### D-RoadmapSequencing (2025-10-07)
**Decision:** Templatization scheduled too early; recommend building Tier 1 features first
**Rationale:** Template with transcripts, search, and platform links has 3-5x higher market value and saves time on all future deployments
**Recommended Sequence:** Fix contribution email ‚Üí Transcripts ‚Üí Search ‚Üí Platform links ‚Üí Address code review issues ‚Üí Templatize
**Documented:** `context/meta/tasks/roadmap-evaluation.md`

### D-ContributionFeature (2025-10-07)
**Decision:** Implement community contribution feature NOW (before templatization)
**Rationale:** User explicitly requested, high value for active podcasts, 95% complete
**Status:** Forms functional, Sanity writes working, email pending domain verification
**Documented:** Session 14 entry in SESSIONS.md

## Next Steps

### For User (Immediate)
1. Review roadmap evaluation report (`context/meta/tasks/roadmap-evaluation.md`)
2. Review code review report (`artifacts/code-reviews/session-14-review.md`)
3. Decide on email notification fix (Option A or B)
4. Approve git push of Session 14 work
5. Prioritize Tier 1 features for next session

### For Next Session (After User Decisions)
1. Fix contribution email notifications
2. Address critical security issues (C1: XSS, C2: resolved with email fix)
3. Begin Tier 1 feature implementation (if user approves roadmap)
   - Transcripts (highest priority, biggest SEO impact)
   - Episode search (high UX value, low complexity)
   - Platform links manual phase

### Long-term (Post-Features, Pre-Templatization)
1. Address high-priority code review issues (H1-H5)
2. Add unit tests for critical paths (improve from 5% coverage)
3. Fix hardcoded values (template readiness)
4. Execute templatization plan (Phase 2b)
