## 1. Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the development of a **reusable podcast website framework** to replace the current Strange Water podcast site (strangewater.xyz) hosted on PodcastPage.io. The framework will be deployed first for Strange Water (69 episodes, completed/archival series), then reused for future podcasts with customized branding and features.

### Dual Goals

1. **Immediate:** Launch performant, SEO-optimized Strange Water site (archival/marketing property)
2. **Strategic:** Build reusable framework/template enabling rapid deployment of future podcast websites

**Learning Feedback Loop:** Strange Water rollout serves as production validation for the framework. All architecture decisions, content workflows, and deployment processes will be documented and abstracted into the template for future shows.

### Development Methodology

**Iterative, Small-Step Approach:**
- ‚úÖ Vertical slices (episode page working end-to-end) over horizontal layers (all pages scaffolded)
- ‚úÖ Deploy continuously from Day 1 (staging), not waiting for "done"
- ‚úÖ Smallest possible increments (half-day tasks, not week-long tasks)
- ‚úÖ Each increment is testable, demonstrable, shippable
- ‚úÖ Refactor as we learn, don't over-engineer upfront

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- ‚ùå Building all components before wiring them together
- ‚ùå Waiting weeks before first deploy
- ‚ùå Large PRs that change 50 files
- ‚ùå "It'll all come together in Week 4"

### Primary Audience Segments & Business Goals

| Segment | Needs | Business Goals |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| **Listeners** | Discover episodes, consume content, subscribe | ‚Üë Organic traffic, ‚Üë session duration, ‚Üë platform subscriptions |
| **Prospective Guests** | Learn about show, assess fit, submit pitch | ‚Üë High-quality guest applications, ‚Üì outreach effort |
| **Partners/Sponsors** | Validate audience, assess brand alignment | ‚Üë Sponsorship inquiries, ‚Üë Patreon conversions |
| **Content Operators** | Publish episodes efficiently, update content | ‚Üì Time to publish, ‚Üì technical friction, ‚Üë content quality |

### Out of Scope (Phase 1)

- ‚ùå Paid membership/premium content tiers
- ‚ùå Community forums or user-generated content (beyond forms)
- ‚ùå Advanced analytics dashboard (custom reporting)
- ‚ùå Mobile apps (native iOS/Android)
- ‚ùå Live streaming or real-time episode publishing
- ‚ùå Podcast hosting (RSS generation, audio distribution)

### Framework Reusability KPIs

- ‚è± **Time to Deploy New Podcast:** <4 hours from zero to production-ready
- üé® **Branding Customization Effort:** <2 hours (colors, fonts, logos, copy)
- ‚úÖ **Launch Checklist Completion:** 100% automated checks (SEO, performance, accessibility)
- üìä **Content Migration Speed:** <1 hour per 50 episodes (scripted import)

---

## 2. Background & Current State

### Current Site Analysis (strangewater.xyz)
**Strengths:**
- Clean, modern design
- Comprehensive guest profiles with images
- Multiple platform subscription options
- Responsive mobile layout
- Good episode metadata display

**Limitations:**
- Paid service ($) with limited flexibility
- Performance constraints
- Cannot customize features
- No control over hosting/infrastructure
- Limited monetization options
- No analytics access or customization

**Current URL Structure (to preserve via redirects):**
- Homepage: `/`
- Episodes: `/episodes`
- Individual Episode: `/episode/[slug]`
- Guests: `/guests`
- Individual Guest: `/person/[slug]`
- About: `/about`

### User Context
- **Site Owner:** High technical proficiency (can manage complex systems)
- **Future Operators:** Entry-level/junior staff (non-technical content coordinators)
- **Strange Water Status:** 69 episodes, ceased production (archival site)
- **Future Podcasts:** Active production, require growth/engagement features

## 11. Phased Implementation Plan (REVISED - Granular & Iterative)

### Implementation Philosophy

**Every increment should be:**
1. **Demonstrable:** Can show working output
2. **Testable:** Can verify it works
3. **Deployable:** Can push to staging immediately
4. **Valuable:** Moves us closer to launch

**Daily Rhythm:**
- Morning: Pick 1-3 tasks from current sub-phase
- Afternoon: Ship to staging, verify, demo
- End of day: Working site exists (even if incomplete)

## 12. Definition of "Done" for Each Increment

Every task must meet these criteria to be considered complete:

1. **Code Quality:**
   - [ ] No TypeScript errors
   - [ ] No console errors in browser
   - [ ] Code follows project conventions (file naming, component structure)

2. **Functionality:**
   - [ ] Feature works as intended (manual test)
   - [ ] Edge cases handled (empty states, long text, missing data)

3. **Deployment:**
   - [ ] Pushed to GitHub
   - [ ] Deployed to staging
   - [ ] Verified working on staging URL

4. **Documentation:**
   - [ ] Inline comments for complex logic
   - [ ] Updated README if adding new scripts/tools
   - [ ] GitHub commit message descriptive

5. **Accessibility (where applicable):**
   - [ ] Keyboard accessible
   - [ ] Proper ARIA labels
   - [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA

---

## 13. Risk Mitigation for Iterative Approach

**Risk:** Too many small tasks feels overwhelming
**Mitigation:** Focus on 1 sub-phase at a time. Don't look ahead at all 100+ tasks.

**Risk:** Tasks depend on each other, can't work in parallel
**Mitigation:** Sub-phases ordered to minimize dependencies. Most tasks within a day are sequential.

**Risk:** Scope creep - "while we're at it, let's add X"
**Mitigation:** Strict "definition of done" per task. New ideas go into GitHub Issues for Phase 2/3.

**Risk:** Deploying broken code to staging
**Mitigation:** Manual test before every push. Staging is for testing, expect some breakage.

**Risk:** Migration script fails on edge case
**Mitigation:** Run on small batch first (5 episodes), validate, then full migration.

**Risk:** Performance optimization at wrong time (premature)
**Mitigation:** Only optimize in Phase 1d (Day 14), after content is live.

---

## 14. Testing & Quality Assurance

### 14.1 Testing Cadence

**Daily (during development):**
- Manual testing of new features (each task)
- Visual inspection (does it look right?)
- Browser DevTools (no console errors)

**Weekly (end of each sub-phase):**
- Lighthouse audit (performance, SEO, accessibility)
- Cross-page navigation test (all links work?)

- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile device testing (iPhone, Android, tablet)
- Screen reader test (3 pages)
- Load testing (1,000 concurrent users via Artillery.io)

### 14.2 Automated Testing (Phase 2)

**Unit Tests:**
- Component tests (Vitest + Testing Library)
- Utility function tests (date formatting, URL parsing)
- Target: >80% coverage for critical paths

**CI/CD Integration (Phase 2):**
- GitHub Actions workflow on every PR
- Lint, type check, build, Lighthouse CI
- Auto-deploy to Netlify preview

### 15.1 Launch Metrics (End of Phase 1, Day 15)

**Technical Excellence:**
- ‚úÖ Lighthouse Performance: >90 (target: >95)
- ‚úÖ Lighthouse SEO: >95 (target: 100)
- ‚úÖ Lighthouse Accessibility: >90 (target: 95)
- ‚úÖ Page load time: <3s (target: <2s)
- ‚úÖ Core Web Vitals: All green (LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1)

**Content Completeness:**
- ‚úÖ All 69 episodes migrated successfully
- ‚úÖ Zero broken links/images (Screaming Frog validation)
- ‚úÖ Mobile usability: 100% (Google Search Console)
- ‚úÖ 100% episode metadata completeness (title, audio, date, show notes)

**SEO Readiness:**
- ‚úÖ XML sitemap submitted to Google Search Console
- ‚úÖ Structured data validation passed (zero errors)
- ‚úÖ 301 redirects functional (all old URLs redirect correctly)
- ‚úÖ robots.txt configured (allows crawling)

### 15.2 Iteration Velocity Metrics

**Phase 1 Target Velocity:**
- **Tasks completed per day:** 8-12 tasks (average ~10)
- **Staging deploys per day:** 3-5 deploys
- **Days to first deploy:** Day 1 (not Week 4!)
- **Days to content-complete site:** Day 11 (not Week 3!)
- **Days to production launch:** Day 15 (matches 4-week estimate, but site usable much earlier)

**Comparison (Waterfall vs. Iterative):**

| Milestone | Waterfall | Iterative (This Plan) |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------|
| First deploy | Week 3 | Day 1 |
| Working episode page | Week 2 | Day 2 |
| Dynamic content | Week 3 | Day 5 |
| All content migrated | Week 4 | Day 11 |
| Production launch | Week 4 | Day 15 |

**Key Insight:** Iterative approach reaches "usable site" 10x faster (Day 3 vs. Week 3).

## 16. Risks, Dependencies & Mitigation

### 16.1 Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Content migration errors** | High | Medium | Automated validation script, manual QA sample (10 episodes), fallback data handling |
| **Tasks take longer than estimated** | Medium | High | Build in buffer days (Day 16-20), prioritize ruthlessly |
| **Sanity API rate limits** | Low | Low | Free tier allows 100k requests/month, we'll use ~1k during migration |
| **Scope creep during development** | Medium | Medium | Strict definition of done, new ideas ‚Üí GitHub Issues for Phase 2 |
| **Developer burnout (too many small tasks)** | Medium | Low | Focus on 1 sub-phase at a time, celebrate daily wins |

### 16.2 External Dependencies

| Dependency | SLA | Rate Limits | Fallback Strategy |
|------------|-----|-------------|-------------------|
| **Sanity API** | 99.9% uptime | 100k requests/month (free tier) | Cache content locally (build time), graceful degradation (stale content) |
| **Netlify Hosting** | 99.9% uptime | 300 build min, 100GB bandwidth/month | Self-hosted fallback (S3 + CloudFront), static export portable |
| **Spotify for Podcasters** | No SLA | Embed rate limits unclear | Direct MP3 URLs as backup, download + self-host audio files |

## Summary of Changes (v3 ‚Üí v4)

### **Complete Rewrite of Section 11: Phased Implementation Plan**

**What Changed:**

1. **Granularity:** Went from ~30 tasks over 4 weeks ‚Üí **100+ tasks** broken into half-day increments
2. **Sub-Phases:** Phase 1 now has 5 sub-phases (1a-1e), each delivering a vertical slice
3. **Daily Breakdown:** First 15 days planned **day-by-day** with morning/afternoon task blocks
4. **Task Size:** Tasks now take 30 min - 2 hours (not 1-2 days)
5. **Iterative Milestones:** Deployed site on Day 1 (not Week 3), content-complete on Day 11 (not Week 4)
6. **Vertical Slices:** Episode page working end-to-end on Day 2 vs. building all components first
7. **New Sections:** Added "Definition of Done" (Section 12), "Iteration Velocity Metrics" (Section 15.2)

**Philosophy Shift:**

- **v3 Approach:** Build all pages ‚Üí add content ‚Üí optimize ‚Üí launch (horizontal layers)
- **v4 Approach:** Build one thing end-to-end ‚Üí deploy ‚Üí iterate ‚Üí expand (vertical slices)

**Impact:**

- **Reduced Risk:** Working site exists from Day 1, not "big bang" on Day 15
- **Faster Feedback:** Can show stakeholders progress daily, not weekly
- **Easier to Execute:** 2-hour tasks feel manageable vs. "build entire homepage" (8+ hours)
- **Better Quality:** Deploy 5x/day = catch bugs immediately vs. find all bugs on launch day

This PRD is now **execution-ready** with a clear, iterative, small-step plan that matches your stated methodology.
