   - Had critical architectural contradictions
   - Mixed npm package + git fork approaches
   - Undefined component override mechanism
   - Unrealistic CLI timeline

   - Recommended: DO NOT PROCEED without fixes

3. **templatization-plan-v2-APPROVED.md** (v2.0) - Fixed architecture
   - Resolved all v1.0 contradictions
   - Clear decisions made
   - BUT: Had technical issues found by Codex

   - Found 5 critical technical issues
   - Component resolver won't work in production
   - Missing Week 0 prerequisites

## Why these were archived

These documents represent the planning evolution but contain outdated/incorrect information:
- v1.0 had architectural contradictions
- v2.0 had technical implementation flaws
- Feedback docs are now incorporated into v2.1

**For historical reference only - do not implement from these files.**

## Lessons Learned

1. **Deep review prevents rework** - Critical review saved weeks of implementation pain
2. **External review valuable** - Codex caught bundler issues we missed
3. **Take time to plan** - Better to spend hours on plan than weeks fixing bad architecture
4. **Document decisions** - Clear reasoning prevents re-litigating choices
