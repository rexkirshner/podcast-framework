# Codex Feedback on Templatization Plan v2.0

## Highlights
- Architecture, repo split, and roadmap read coherently and line up with the approved decisions.
- Thoughtful attention to upgrade paths (Changesets + CLI + rollback) and Sanity schema versioning reduces long-term maintenance friction.
- Documentation, testing, and success metrics sections already frame a professional product launch.

## Recommended Improvements
1. **Make the component resolver bundler-safe** – The current `getComponent` approach relies on dynamic `import('/src/...')` paths that Vite/Astro cannot statically analyze, so those imports will fail once packaged. Consider building a manifest with `import.meta.glob` (or a generated map during build) that first checks local overrides and then falls back to framework components, rather than try/catch on absolute import strings (`context/tasks/active/templatization-plan-v2-APPROVED.md:288`).
2. **Right-size automated schema migrations** – The example migration script assumes the CLI can infer domain-specific transforms like converting `duration` strings to seconds (`context/tasks/active/templatization-plan-v2-APPROVED.md:704`). That expectation may not hold across podcasts and could create false confidence. I’d scope the CLI to scaffold a migration template with TODOs and helper utilities, but require humans to review/edit the transformation logic before execution.
3. **Re-scope multi-podcast deploy automation** – `workspace deploy-all` implies the CLI stores deployment credentials and abstracts provider-specific flows (Cloudflare, Netlify, etc.), which introduces sizable security and engineering surface area (`context/tasks/active/templatization-plan-v2-APPROVED.md:1292`). I’d downgrade deployment orchestration to a backlog item and keep workspace mode focused on update visibility until there’s a concrete credential management design.
4. **Add phase gates and quality bars** – The roadmap lists deliverables per phase but lacks explicit exit criteria (e.g., coverage thresholds, docs drafted, manual QA complete). Adding a short “Definition of done” for each phase will help prevent downstream surprises and track scope creep during the 12–14 week effort.
5. **Capture npm/org setup as a prerequisite** – The plan assumes availability of the `@podcast-framework` scope, npm org, and 2FA-enabled publisher accounts. Call that out in Week 0/Immediate Actions to avoid painful renaming later and to align with the publishing workflow you describe (`context/tasks/active/templatization-plan-v2-APPROVED.md:252`).

## Follow-ups / Questions
- How will templated projects get usable starter content? A lightweight Sanity dataset seeding story would streamline local dev and showcase the schema package.
- Do we want an explicit rollback strategy for docs/template repos alongside npm packages when a bad release ships?

Happy to iterate on any of these points.
