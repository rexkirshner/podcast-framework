## üîÆ Future Automation Requirements (Phase 2/3)

**Context:** Strange Water is a completed podcast (manual workflow acceptable)
**Priority:** Critical for active podcasts in Phase 2+

### Episode Artwork Automation

**Current Limitation:**
- RSS feed from Anchor.fm is no longer accessible (404 error)
- Episode artwork visible in Spotify embed but not imported to Sanity
- Strange Water: Manual upload acceptable (69 episodes, one-time task)
- **Future podcasts:** MUST have automated artwork import

**Required Solutions (Research & Implement in Phase 2):**

1. **Spotify Web API Integration** (Recommended)
   - [ ] Research Spotify Web API episode metadata endpoints
   - [ ] Create Spotify Developer account and app credentials
   - [ ] Build script to fetch episode data including artwork URLs
   - [ ] Implement artwork download and Sanity upload
   - [ ] Test with active podcast feed
   - **Pros:** Direct source of truth, high-quality images
   - **Cons:** Requires API credentials, rate limits

2. **Alternative RSS Sources** (Fallback)
   - [ ] Research Spotify RSS feed alternatives (if available)
   - [ ] Check Apple Podcasts RSS feed structure
   - [ ] Evaluate YouTube RSS feeds for video podcasts
   - [ ] Build multi-source RSS parser with fallbacks
   - **Pros:** No API credentials needed
   - **Cons:** Feed availability varies by platform

3. **Webhook-Based Automation** (Ideal)
   - [ ] Research podcast hosting platform webhooks (Spotify, Anchor, etc.)
   - [ ] Build webhook receiver endpoint
   - [ ] Implement automatic Sanity update on new episode publish
   - [ ] Include artwork, show notes, and all metadata
   - **Pros:** Real-time, zero manual work
   - **Cons:** Platform-dependent, complex setup

**Success Criteria for Phase 2:**
- New episode published ‚Üí Artwork auto-imported within 5 minutes
- Zero manual uploads required for active podcasts
- Framework supports multiple podcast platforms (Spotify, Apple, YouTube)

**Documentation Needed:**
- API integration guide for Spotify/Apple
- Webhook setup instructions
- Troubleshooting guide for artwork import failures

## üîî Upgrade Reminders

### Claude Context System v2.0.0 Upgrade
**Status:** Deferred to optimal window
**Version Available:** v2.0.0 (CONTEXT.md, STATUS.md, DECISIONS.md, QUICK_REF.md)
**Current Version:** v1.x (CLAUDE.md, SESSIONS.md)

**‚ö†Ô∏è PROACTIVE REMINDER TRIGGERS:**
1. **After Phase 1 launch complete** (Day 15+) - REMIND USER
2. **Before Phase 2 planning starts** (Day 16-20) - REMIND USER
