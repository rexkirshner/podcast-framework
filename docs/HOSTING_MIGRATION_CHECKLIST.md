# Hosting Platform Migration Checklist

Use this checklist when migrating to a new hosting platform (Netlify, Cloudflare, Vercel, etc.).

---

## Pre-Migration Assessment

### 1. Platform Compatibility Review

- [ ] **Runtime Environment**
  - [ ] Identify Node.js version requirements
  - [ ] Check if platform uses Node.js or alternative runtime (V8 isolates, Edge runtime)

  - [ ] Verify environment variable access method
  - [ ] Confirm timeout limits are acceptable
  - [ ] Test cold start performance requirements

### 2. Feature Inventory

- [ ] **Static Pages**
  - [ ] List all static routes

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Environment variables undefined
**Solution:** Use hosting adapter to access env vars correctly for each platform

### Issue: Module not found errors
**Solution:** Check if package is compatible with platform runtime (V8 vs Node.js)

### Issue: Services failing at module level
**Solution:** Move service initialization inside request handlers (lazy loading)

### Issue: Window/document not defined
**Solution:** Add `typeof window !== 'undefined'` checks, use SSR-safe packages

### Issue: Cold start timeouts
**Solution:** Reduce bundle size, minimize dependencies, optimize initialization

### Issue: CORS errors
**Solution:** Configure CORS headers in API routes, check domain allowlist
