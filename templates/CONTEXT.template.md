## What Is This Project?

**[Project Name]** - [2-3 sentence description: what it does, why it exists, who it's for]

**Goals:**
- [Primary goal 1]
- [Primary goal 2]
- [Primary goal 3]

**Key Stakeholders:**
- Owner: [Name/role]
- Users: [Who uses this]
- Contributors: [Who maintains it]

---

## Getting Started

**First time here? (5-minute startup)**

1. **Read STATUS.md Quick Reference** (30 seconds)
   - ✅ Checkpoint: Can you find production URL and current phase?

2. **Check Active Tasks in STATUS.md** (2 minutes)
   - ✅ Checkpoint: Know what needs doing next?

3. **Review last session in SESSIONS.md** (2 minutes)
   - ✅ Checkpoint: Understand recent work and decisions?

4. **Start working** ✅

**Need deeper context? (30-minute orientation)**
- Read this file (CONTEXT.md) for architecture → 10 minutes
- Read DECISIONS.md for technical rationale → 15 minutes
- Read recent SESSIONS.md entries for recent work → 5 minutes

**For AI agents taking over:**
Recommended: Complete 30-minute orientation above + review last 3 sessions in SESSIONS.md (45 minutes total) for full context.

## Tech Stack

**Core Technologies:**
- **Framework:** [e.g., Next.js 15] - [One-line rationale, see DECISIONS.md:REF if detailed]
- **Language:** [e.g., TypeScript] - [One-line rationale]
- **Database:** [e.g., PostgreSQL] - [One-line rationale]
- **Hosting:** [e.g., Vercel] - [One-line rationale]
- **[Other key tech]:** [Brief description]

**Why these choices?**
Brief summary of the tech stack philosophy. For detailed decision rationale, see [DECISIONS.md](./DECISIONS.md).

## High-Level Architecture

**Type:** [Web App / API / CLI / Library / Mobile App]

**Architecture Pattern:** [e.g., Server-rendered with API routes, Microservices, Monolith, etc.]

**System Diagram:**
```
[Optional simple ASCII diagram showing main components]

Example for web app:
┌─────────────┐
│   Browser   │
└──────┬──────┘
       │
┌──────▼──────────┐
│   Next.js App   │
│  (Pages + API)  │
└──────┬──────────┘
       │
┌──────▼──────────┐
│   Database      │
└─────────────────┘
```

**Key Components:**
- **[Component 1]:** [Purpose and responsibility]
- **[Component 2]:** [Purpose and responsibility]
- **[Component 3]:** [Purpose and responsibility]

**Data Flow:**
[1-2 paragraphs describing how data moves through the system]

**For detailed architectural decisions:** See [DECISIONS.md](./DECISIONS.md)

## Directory Structure

```

**File Organization Principles:**
- [Principle 1, e.g., "Colocation - tests next to source"]
- [Principle 2, e.g., "Feature folders, not type folders"]
- [Principle 3, e.g., "Shared code in /lib"]

---

## Development Workflow

**Core Principles:**
1. **Plan First** - Understand the problem before writing code
2. **Test in Dev** - Verify locally before committing
3. **Incremental Changes** - Small, focused commits
4. **Root Cause Solutions** - No temporary fixes or band-aids
5. **Minimal Impact** - Change only what's necessary
6. **Full Code Tracing** - Debug by following entire flow, no assumptions

**Git Workflow:**
- Branch: [Strategy - feature branches, trunk-based, etc.]
- Commits: [Convention - conventional commits, semantic, etc.]
- **Push Protocol:** NEVER push without explicit user approval
  - See [DECISIONS.md](./DECISIONS.md) for detailed push protocol
  - Current status: See STATUS.md for git state

**Testing Approach:**
- **Unit Tests:** [When/what to test]
- **Integration Tests:** [Coverage expectations]
- **E2E Tests:** [If applicable]
- **Current Test Status:** See STATUS.md

**For detailed workflow decisions:** See [DECISIONS.md](./DECISIONS.md)

## Environment Setup

**Prerequisites:**
- [e.g., Node.js 20+]
- [e.g., PostgreSQL 15+]
- [e.g., Other tools]

**Initial Setup:**

## Communication & Workflow Preferences

> **📋 Source of Truth:** All preferences are defined in `context/.context-config.json`
> The guidance below is derived from that configuration.

**Communication Style:**
- Direct, concise responses without preamble
- High-level summaries of changes (e.g., "Changed X to Y in file.ts:123")
- Honest assessment of confidence levels
- Simple solutions over complex ones
- No emojis unless explicitly requested

**What to Avoid:**
- Verbose explanations unless requested
- Pushing to GitHub without explicit approval
- Making assumptions about user intent
- Temporary fixes instead of root cause solutions

**Task Management:**
- Use TodoWrite tool for tracking tasks
- Create todo items that can be checked off during work
- Mark complete as you go, one task at a time

**Session Management:**
- Use `/save` for quick session updates (2-3 min)
- Use `/save-full` before breaks/handoffs (10-15 min)
- See `.claude/commands/` for all available commands
