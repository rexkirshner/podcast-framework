## Example: Initial Session

Here's what your first session entry might look like after running `/init-context` and `/save`:

## Session 1 | 2025-10-09 | Project Initialization

**Duration:** 0.5h | **Focus:** Setup Claude Context System v2.1 | **Status:** ✅ Complete

### TL;DR

Initialized Claude Context System v2.1 with 4 core files + 1 AI header (claude.md). System ready for minimal-overhead documentation during development with comprehensive save points before breaks.

### Changed

- ✅ Initialized Claude Context System v2.1
- ✅ Created 4 core documentation files + 1 AI header (claude.md, CONTEXT, STATUS, DECISIONS, SESSIONS)
- ✅ Configured .context-config.json with version 2.1.0

### Decisions

- **Documentation System:** Chose Claude Context System v2.1 for session continuity and AI agent handoffs
- **File Structure:** Using v2.1 structure with STATUS.md as single source of truth (includes auto-generated Quick Reference)

### Files

**NEW:**
- `context/claude.md` - AI header (entry point for Claude)
- `context/CONTEXT.md` - Project orientation (platform-neutral)
- `context/STATUS.md` - Single source of truth with auto-generated Quick Reference section
- `context/DECISIONS.md` - Decision log with rationale
- `context/SESSIONS.md` - This file (structured session history)
- `context/.context-config.json` - System configuration v2.1.0

### Next Session

**Priority:** Begin development work with context system in place
**Blockers:** None
**Questions:** None - system ready to use

## Tips

**For AI Agent Review & Takeover:**
- **Mental models are critical** - AI needs to understand your thinking
- **Capture constraints** - AI should know what limitations existed
- **Explain rationale** - WHY you chose this approach
- **Document gotchas** - Save AI from discovering the same issues
- **Show problem-solving** - AI learns from your approach

**Be structured AND comprehensive:**
- Use structured format (scannable sections)
- But include depth (mental models, rationale, constraints)
- 40-60 lines per session is appropriate for AI understanding
- Structured ≠ minimal. AI needs context.

**Key sections for AI:**
1. **Problem Solved** - What issue existed, constraints, approach
2. **Mental Models** - Your understanding of the system
3. **Decisions** - Link to DECISIONS.md for full rationale
4. **Work In Progress** - Detailed enough for takeover
5. **TodoWrite State** - What was accomplished vs. pending
